## How Do I Stop Someone From Tracking My Vivo S17 Pro?

It has now become very easy to track a Smartphone using the GPS features of the phone. This can be done by tracking the phone number based on information derived from mobile carriers and also from the GPS chip on the phone which is used by certain apps in order to function well.

You may not want your GPS location tracked by anyone or by apps on your device. When playing games like Pokémon Go, the geo-location data on your device is used to pinpoint where you are for purposes of gameplay. In the same manner, malicious people can track you same way. Here you will learn how to stop someone from tracking your phone in simple and easy ways.

## Part 1: How do people track your phone?

There are several ways in which people can track the location of your phone. This can be risky at times, especially if you have a stalker. These are the common ways in which people track phones:

GPS location: all Smartphones come with a GPS chip, which continually gives the GPS location of your device. This is great for several features to work on the phone, but it can also be exploited by malicious people. The GPS location is also used to find lost devices or persons who are challenged in finding directions and may get lost. Therefore the GPS chip function is a double-edged sword.

IMEI information: This is information that can be tracked using data that is found on your mobile provider's servers. This is the information that law enforcers use to track crooks, and rescue teams use to track people lost in disaster zones. The IMEI gets recorded when your mobile device pings off mobile transmission towers that are nearby

The apps that are used by people to track mobile devices will track one of these two features. If you do not want to be tracked, then you have to find ways in which to disable these functions.

The sections below will show you how to stop someone from tracking your iPhone with ease.

1\. To use mSpy, you need to visit its website right [here](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH96F) and create your new account. Ideally, you need to follow similar steps as KidsGuard Pro’s installation to use mSpy.

2\. After creating your mSpy account and getting a paid subscription, you need to access the target device.

3\. Go to its Settings > Security and make sure that the option of downloading from Unknown Sources is turned on.

4\. Afterward, you can go to its website and download the app.

5\. Install and perform the setup of the app with your own account credentials.

6\. Once it is done, you can access its web-based dashboard remotely and gain all the needed information related to the target device.

Even though mSpy provides similar features to that of KidsGuard Pro, it only works on rooted (and jailbroken) devices. Additionally, it is comparatively more expensive than KidsGuard Pro and doesn’t truly have a full-invisible mode. Any smart user can detect the spying app, which might land you in trouble.

## Part 2: How to Track My Boyfriend's Phone via KidsGuard Pro?

As I wanted to learn how can I track my boyfriend’s phone, I stumbled upon an amazing tool – [KidsGuard Pro](https://www.clevguard.com/android-parental-control/). It provided a highly reliable and secure way to track a device’s location, its vital content, and so much more. Easy to download and use, KidsGuard Pro doesn’t require you to root your Vivo S17 Pro. After installing it on the target device, you can track it from the web dashboard control panel remotely.

Since it runs in stealth mode, it allowed me to track my boyfriend’s phone without getting detected. Besides his real-time location, I was able to know his call logs, contacts, photos, social media activity, and so much more in one place. It allowed me to track my boyfriend in a trouble-free manner. You can also do the same by following these steps:

1\. Firstly, visit KidsGuard Pro’s official website right [here](https://panel.clevguard.com/sign-up?dev_tp=android) and create your new account. You need to sign-up with your email id and set up a strong password.

4\. Furthermore, you can simply visit the desired section from the left panel to get in-depth access. For instance, by visiting the “Locations” section, you can view the real-time location of the Vivo S17 Pro device, the previously visited places, and more.

After following these instructions, I was also able to track my boyfriend without much trouble. KidsGuard Pro also provides a seamless way to track the social media activity on the target device, record calls, listen to its surroundings, etc. Furthermore, you can enable its Keylogging feature as well to get a comprehensive record of everything typed on the Vivo S17 Pro device. By using these amazing features, I was able to track my boyfriend’s phone without getting detected.

Since KidsGuard Pro is compatible with all the leading Android and iOS devices, you can take its assistance without facing any setbacks. I used it to track my boyfriend’s phone and so can you. Nevertheless, before you proceed, make sure that you are not doing anything illegal. You should either own the phone you are tracking or inform the other person beforehand. This will prevent you from any unforeseen situation. Now when you know better, you can easily use KidsGuard Pro to track any Android or iOS device.
