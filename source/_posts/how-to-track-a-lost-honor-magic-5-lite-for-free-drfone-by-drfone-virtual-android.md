## Part 1: How to Track lost iPhone for Free?

One of the noteworthy features of iPhones is that they tend to retain great value for many years to come hence they become a preferred choice for prying thieves. Further, they can be expensive for most budgets to begin with, so losing or misplacing your iPhone can cause a fair amount of heartache. Apple provides one of the best answers to how to track iPhones for free with its exclusive iCloud.

But before we move ahead and explain how to track your lost phone for free with iCloud, we should tell you that it is limited in its cell location tracking and other features in that it will only send a message to the Honor Magic 5 Lite device, lock or erase it, and not provide records of information traffic going in and out of the Honor Magic 5 Lite device. Here’s how to track lost iPhones for free.

Step 1. You will first need to ensure that the Find My iPhone feature is enabled on your device. This can be easily done by first launching the settings app on your iPhone, tapping on Apple ID at the top, and then iCloud and then Find My iPhone. Lastly, tab to enable it.

Step 2. Now it’s time to hit the cloud—iCloud we mean! First things first—head to <www.iCloud.com> from any browser and login with your credentials. From the dashboard, click on Find iPhone in the second row and enter your Apple ID and password if prompted. Since you may have several Apple devices connected with the same iCloud account, click on All Devices at the top, and select the Honor Magic 5 Lite device you wish to track from the dropdown.

## 2\. Mobile Number Locator

This app is entirely Android-oriented and it's as effective as it comes. It's free and requires no registration cost or anything hi-fi; but, just a set of fingers and there!

Mobile Number Locator permits you to trace the information about any mobile number code which includes data on Service Provider, State or Reference City. It is designed to display the caller location of all the incoming and outgoing calls over your call screen. The app is only so efficient if you got a miss call from the person on whom you want to do a little background snooping.

This app cannot trace Mobile Ported Numbers and it can only show the State Location of the caller.

Where do you think these creators of number locators gather all this personal information from? It's absolutely frightening to think of how they would get hold of our information, isn't it? But, that's a topic for another day. It's certainly helpful if one doesn't misuse this information for their own personal gain now, right?
