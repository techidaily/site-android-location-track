Even though mSpy provides similar features to that of KidsGuard Pro, it only works on rooted (and jailbroken) devices.

![phone number locator-Caller ID and Number Locator](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/11/15099056309953.jpg)

**Features**

- This software works through a database of added information on more than 12,982 cities.
- The call identifier feature will let you in on the real caller before you can answer the phone.
- There is also the option of a call blocker in case your caller gets too annoying to handle! (Or too offensive.)

**Pros**

- It doesn't necessarily require an Internet connection.
- This app has spread its wings over 200 countries globally.
- The location of the caller and the caller ID is viewable.
- With the caller blocker feature, it's possible to block any annoying caller.
- The availability of a Google map positioning technology makes it easier to pinpoint the exact location.

**Cons**

- It doesn't work on Android versions below 4.0.

## 5\. Truecaller

This is noted as the best leading app over the globe. There must be some better features compared to the previous ones if that's the case, yes?

It is cited to be the best caller ID app and it even blocks danger-rangers, their calls, and SMS. You can identify the person or the company that calls you before picking up. Be it landlines, mobile, or pre-paid even if you don't have the contact stored in your device!

You don't have to worry about telemarketers calling you or robocalls anymore. Spammers can't make an appearance ever again and consider yourself safe for life.

![phone number locator-Truecaller](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/11/15099056551018.jpg)

**Features**

- This renowned app has got a block feature.
- This is the best- you can view the caller's profile that includes their name and photo!
- There is also a contact directory that will help you find an unknown number.
- You need not worry if your phonebook contacts get uploaded- this is an impossibility where Truecaller is concerned.
- If you end up calling the wrong number, they might search you up (!) and you would definitely know it too. Another perk!
- This app undoubtedly offers the best tracking services.

**Pros**

- Your phonebook contacts won't be uploaded online.
- It's easy to know if you were searched online (or, your number for that matter).
- It's possible to make calls directly from the app.
- This app has got over 200 million users as it offers the most trusted and efficient services to make their customers happy.

**Cons**

- It requests an Internet connection.
- You must supply your phone number to the makers for this app to work.

## 6\. Number Locator

This iPhone-based software works on simple terms- all you must do is copy-paste the number in the search bar and hit search.

It works expeditiously as they have got a working database system. With the ready-made information just beneath your fingertips, it makes it even better for you as you can carry on with your expeditions with unknown numbers both offline and online!

Where do you think these creators of number locators gather all this personal information from? It's absolutely frightening to think of how they would get hold of our information, isn't it? But, that's a topic for another day. It's certainly helpful if one doesn't misuse this information for their own personal gain now, right?
