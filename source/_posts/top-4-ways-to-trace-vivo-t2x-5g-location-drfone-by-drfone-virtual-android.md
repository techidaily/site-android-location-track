## Part 2: How to Track Lost Android Mobile Location?

If you’ve misplaced your Vivo T2x 5G cell phone, have no fear, because there are few ways to help you track its location. There are a few things to do before you can begin tracking an Android device such as have an active and connected Google account (something you already set up when you bought the Vivo T2x 5G device), and locations services on the Vivo T2x 5G device enabled. Even though your mobile manufacturer may offer their own exclusive solution to track your phone, Google’s Find My Device (formerly Android Device Manager) is probably the most easiest and trusted way to go with. Here’s how to track your lost phone with Google’s ADM.

Step 1. Most latest Android phones are already equipped with the Find My Service, but if you’re missing it, you can download it from the Google Play Store. Click start, tap security, and then device administration.
