## How Do I Stop Someone From Tracking My Oppo A59 5G?

It has now become very easy to track a Smartphone using the GPS features of the phone. This can be done by tracking the phone number based on information derived from mobile carriers and also from the GPS chip on the phone which is used by certain apps in order to function well.

You may not want your GPS location tracked by anyone or by apps on your device. When playing games like Pokémon Go, the geo-location data on your device is used to pinpoint where you are for purposes of gameplay. In the same manner, malicious people can track you same way. Here you will learn how to stop someone from tracking your phone in simple and easy ways.

## Part 1: How do people track your phone?

There are several ways in which people can track the location of your phone. This can be risky at times, especially if you have a stalker. These are the common ways in which people track phones:

GPS location: all Smartphones come with a GPS chip, which continually gives the GPS location of your device. This is great for several features to work on the phone, but it can also be exploited by malicious people. The GPS location is also used to find lost devices or persons who are challenged in finding directions and may get lost. Therefore the GPS chip function is a double-edged sword.

IMEI information: This is information that can be tracked using data that is found on your mobile provider's servers. This is the information that law enforcers use to track crooks, and rescue teams use to track people lost in disaster zones. The IMEI gets recorded when your mobile device pings off mobile transmission towers that are nearby

The apps that are used by people to track mobile devices will track one of these two features. If you do not want to be tracked, then you have to find ways in which to disable these functions.

The sections below will show you how to stop someone from tracking your iPhone with ease.

### 2) Turn off Android Location Tracking

Apart from stopping Google tracking on your device, you may also turn off Location tracking of other apps as shown below

- Start by going to your "Settings" app and then choosing "Security & Location"
- Scroll around and look for the "Use Location" option and then toggle it to the "OFF" position

Many people would stop at this time and think that their location is fully turned off, but this is not the case. The Android device could still be tracked using IMEI, Wi-Fi, and many other sensors. To disable these, go to the "advanced" option and then toggle off the following features:

Google Emergency Location Service. This is a service that tells emergency services where you are located when you dial the emergency service number.

Google Location Accuracy. This is a GPS feature that uses the Wi-Fi address and other services to show your location.

Google Location History. With this, you can switch off the collection of your location history.

Google Location Sharing. This will turn off location sharing if you use it to connect with friends and family.

If you want to stop Google from tracking your location, these are the methods that you should use to turn off your GPS location on both iOS and Android. You need to know that you are safe all the time and this is a step that you should take when you feel like you are being tracked for nefarious reasons. However, you should do this with caution as the information can also be used in a beneficial manner. The best option is to turn on the GPS when you need it and then turn it off when you do not, or use an iOS spoofing tool.
