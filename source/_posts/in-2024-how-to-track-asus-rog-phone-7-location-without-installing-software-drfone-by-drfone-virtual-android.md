## Solutions to Spy on Asus ROG Phone 7 with and without jailbreak

It is no secret that you can easily spy on any iPhone. Many spy or monitoring programs make it easy. All you have do is have access to the iPhone you want to spy on and have a reliable spy program. The problem is, there are some spy programs that will only work on a jailbroken device. This can be a problem when you don’t want the Asus ROG Phone 7 device’s owner to know of your activities and the owner has no intention to jailbreak their device.

In this article, we look at how you to spy on an iPhone without needing a jailbreak and how to spy on a jailbroken device or jailbreak a device to facilitate spying.


## Part 1: How to Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak

The majority of spy apps in the market will only work on a jailbroken device or require you to jailbreak an iPhone before you can use them. While a jailbroken device does have its advantages, it can be quite problematic when you want to spy on an iPhone without alerting the owner to your activities. To begin with, you must have the iPhone to jailbreak it, a factor that makes it easier to get caught trying to spy on the Asus ROG Phone 7 device. Also, it is quite possible no matter how hard you try to hide the jailbreaking app that the owner will realize you have jailbroken their device.

For the best results you want to use a monitoring program that doesn’t require a jailbroken device to work. The best is [mSpy](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6), a monitoring program that will work on any iPhone and provide you with detailed information without the need to jailbreak the Asus ROG Phone 7 device. Here’s how to use mSpy to spy on an iPhone.

Step 1: Begin by activating iCloud Backup on the target device. Go to Settings and then select “iCloud” to do this. Using mSpy will require iCloud to be activated.

![Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak-activate iCloud Backup](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079744896475.jpg)

## Part 2: How to Spy using Spyware that Requires a Jailbreak

Being able to spy on an iPhone without a jailbreak is not something that happens often. This is because unlike mSpy, most monitoring software will require you jailbreak the Asus ROG Phone 7 device before you can install the software. One of those apps is TruthSpy. Like mSpy, this app will allow users to see all types of data on the target device without the owner of the Asus ROG Phone 7 device knowing they are being monitored. The only problem is, you need to have access to the Asus ROG Phone 7 device to jailbreak it. If this is what you prefer or are unable to get access to mSpy, TruthSpy will work just fine. Here’s how to use it.

Step 1: Begin by performing a jailbreak on the target device. There are several options to help you do that like Pangu software.

![Spy using Spyware with jailbreak-Pangu software](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074779011456.jpg)

Step 2: Once the Asus ROG Phone 7 device is successfully jailbroken, create an account with TruthSpy, purchase a subscription and you will receive instructions on how to install the software on the jailbroken device.

Step 3: You can then log in to TurthSpy with your log in information and access all types of data on the target iPhone from any bowser.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://ukaidot.sjv.io/c/5597632/1793234/19578" target="_top" id="1793234"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19578-1793234" border="0" alt="" width="678" height="452"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793234/19578" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Spy using Spyware with jailbreak-log in to TurthSpy](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079742762274.jpg)

Both mSpy and TruthSpy will provide you with all the information you need about the target device. The only difference is, you need to jailbreak the Asus ROG Phone 7 device if TruthSpy will be able to access it. Jailbreaking the

device will however make it easier for the Asus ROG Phone 7 device’s owner to find the spyware and remove it before you are able to complete your activities. It is therefore preferable to use a program like mSpy that requires no jailbreak.

## 5\. Truecaller

This is noted as the best leading app over the globe. There must be some better features compared to the previous ones if that's the case, yes?

It is cited to be the best caller ID app and it even blocks danger-rangers, their calls, and SMS. You can identify the person or the company that calls you before picking up. Be it landlines, mobile, or pre-paid even if you don't have the contact stored in your device!

You don't have to worry about telemarketers calling you or robocalls anymore. Spammers can't make an appearance ever again and consider yourself safe for life.

![phone number locator-Truecaller](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/11/15099056551018.jpg)

**Features**

- This renowned app has got a block feature.
- This is the best- you can view the caller's profile that includes their name and photo!
- There is also a contact directory that will help you find an unknown number.
- You need not worry if your phonebook contacts get uploaded- this is an impossibility where Truecaller is concerned.
- If you end up calling the wrong number, they might search you up (!) and you would definitely know it too. Another perk!
- This app undoubtedly offers the best tracking services.

**Pros**

- Your phonebook contacts won't be uploaded online.
- It's easy to know if you were searched online (or, your number for that matter).
- It's possible to make calls directly from the app.
- This app has got over 200 million users as it offers the most trusted and efficient services to make their customers happy.

**Cons**

- It requests an Internet connection.
- You must supply your phone number to the makers for this app to work.

## 6\. Number Locator

This iPhone-based software works on simple terms- all you must do is copy-paste the number in the search bar and hit search.

It works expeditiously as they have got a working database system. With the ready-made information just beneath your fingertips, it makes it even better for you as you can carry on with your expeditions with unknown numbers both offline and online!

**Pros**

- It has an interactive user interface.
- It doesn't require an active Internet connection.
- It works on iPad, iPhone, and iPod.
- Its lovely animated graphics attract the majority of the user-ship.
- It delivers data quickly.

**Cons**

- The utilization of the app may be affected if it's continuously run.

## 7\. Mobile Number Tracker Pro

This app has got unrivaled tracking features that will let you know who the unwelcome caller is by the end of the search.

Mobile Number Tracker Pro gives you an insight into an unknown caller's City, State, and telecom operator company name. You don't require a working Internet connection, only the latest version of this app to get you on track!

It's really quick in showing the results, details, and that's what makes this app a popular one.

![phone number locator-Mobile Number Tracker Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/11/15099057098598.jpg)

**Features**

- Its database spans more than 200 countries all over the globe.
- Its notification center will supply you with an alert once the searched number's location is found.
- Its interactive user interface attracts the majority of the users.
- If you want, you can make calls or send messages from the app itself.

**Pros**

**Cons**

- The map locator is not always very high-octane as it may fail to show you the actual location.
- It needs an active internet connection to work.

Where do you think these creators of number locators gather all this personal information from? It's absolutely frightening to think of how they would get hold of our information, isn't it? But, that's a topic for another day. It's certainly helpful if one doesn't misuse this information for their own personal gain now, right?
