## Two Ways to Track My Boyfriend's Realme GT 5 Pro without Him Knowing

How can I track my boyfriend’s phone? If you also have the same question, then this would be the last post you’ll read. A while back, I was a little suspicious of my boyfriend’s behavior and wanted to track my boyfriend’s phone. As I did some research, I discovered that even though there are lots of spying tools out there, only a handful of them yields the desired results. I handpicked two apps to track my boyfriend and they certainly met my expectations. Therefore, I have provided a stepwise tutorial to use them right here.

## Part 1: How to Track My Boyfriend's Phone via mSpy?

When I wanted to learn how can I track my boyfriend’s phone, I tried various third-party solutions. I tried [mSpy](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH96F) .

![track my boyfriend’s phone-via mSpy](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082599886089.jpg)

1\. To use mSpy, you need to visit its website right [here](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH96F) and create your new account. Ideally, you need to follow similar steps as KidsGuard Pro’s installation to use mSpy.

2\. After creating your mSpy account and getting a paid subscription, you need to access the target device.

3\. Go to its Settings > Security and make sure that the option of downloading from Unknown Sources is turned on.

4\. Afterward, you can go to its website and download the app.

5\. Install and perform the setup of the app with your own account credentials.

6\. Once it is done, you can access its web-based dashboard remotely and gain all the needed information related to the target device.

Even though mSpy provides similar features to that of KidsGuard Pro, it only works on rooted (and jailbroken) devices. Additionally, it is comparatively more expensive than KidsGuard Pro and doesn’t truly have a full-invisible mode. Any smart user can detect the spying app, which might land you in trouble.

## How Do I Stop Someone From Tracking My Realme GT 5 Pro?

It has now become very easy to track a Smartphone using the GPS features of the phone. This can be done by tracking the phone number based on information derived from mobile carriers and also from the GPS chip on the phone which is used by certain apps in order to function well.

You may not want your GPS location tracked by anyone or by apps on your device. When playing games like Pokémon Go, the geo-location data on your device is used to pinpoint where you are for purposes of gameplay. In the same manner, malicious people can track you same way. Here you will learn how to stop someone from tracking your phone in simple and easy ways.

## Part 1: How do people track your phone?

There are several ways in which people can track the location of your phone. This can be risky at times, especially if you have a stalker. These are the common ways in which people track phones:

GPS location: all Smartphones come with a GPS chip, which continually gives the GPS location of your device. This is great for several features to work on the phone, but it can also be exploited by malicious people. The GPS location is also used to find lost devices or persons who are challenged in finding directions and may get lost. Therefore the GPS chip function is a double-edged sword.

IMEI information: This is information that can be tracked using data that is found on your mobile provider's servers. This is the information that law enforcers use to track crooks, and rescue teams use to track people lost in disaster zones. The IMEI gets recorded when your mobile device pings off mobile transmission towers that are nearby

The apps that are used by people to track mobile devices will track one of these two features. If you do not want to be tracked, then you have to find ways in which to disable these functions.

The sections below will show you how to stop someone from tracking your iPhone with ease.

## Part 2: How to stop my iPhone from being tracked?

## Part 1: Can You Track Messages on WhatsApp?

Before going after **how to spy on someone's WhatsApp**, it is essential to find out if it is possible in the first place. WhatsApp is renowned for its end-to-end encryption. It is a security feature that ensures messages remain private. Moreover, these messages are accessible only to the intended recipients. This encryption makes it extremely challenging to intercept or track WhatsApp messages.

That means it is unlikely that tracking could be done directly through the app's servers. However, there are certain scenarios and methods through which WhatsApp messages can be tracked. These scenarios include WhatsApp Web, Backup extraction, spyware or WhatsApp tracker, notification monitoring, and social engineering.

Nowadays, the demand for monitoring WhatsApp messages has increased significantly. It is mainly due to the rise of cybercrimes. However, it's important to note that the most reliable tracking solutions often come with a price tag. That being said, a few free methods are available to answer **how to spy on WhatsApp messages Android free**. In this section, we will explore these options and their limitation:

### Method 1. Use Online WhatsApp Web to Track WhatsApp Messages

[WhatsApp Web](https://drfone.wondershare.com/whatsapp/whatsapp-web-not-working.html) is a feature provided by WhatsApp. It allows users to access their WhatsApp accounts on a web browser. That makes it a convenient way to track WhatsApp messages remotely. However, it is as long as you can access the target device for the initial setup. To set up WhatsApp Web, you will need physical access to the Realme GT 5 Pro device on which the targeted WhatsApp account is active.

Next, open a web browser on a computer or another device, such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge. Visit the official WhatsApp page by typing "web.whatsapp.com" in the web browser's address bar. Following this, you will see a unique QR code that you need to scan with the target phone. Now, on the target device, open WhatsApp and go to the menu. From the menu, select "Linked Devices."

Finally, point the Realme GT 5 Pro device's camera toward the QR code displayed on the web page. Once the code is scanned, the WhatsApp account will be mirrored on the web browser. You need to get physical access to the targeted device. Also, the Realme GT 5 Pro device must remain connected to the internet.
