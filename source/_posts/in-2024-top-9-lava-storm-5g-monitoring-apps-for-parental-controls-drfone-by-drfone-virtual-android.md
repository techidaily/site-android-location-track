## Part 2: How to Track Lost Android Mobile Location?

If youâve misplaced your Lava Storm 5G cell phone, have no fear, because there are few ways to help you track its location. There are a few things to do before you can begin tracking an Android device such as have an active and connected Google account (something you already set up when you bought the Lava Storm 5G device), and locations services on the Lava Storm 5G device enabled.

Step 1. Most latest Android phones are already equipped with the Find My Service, but if youâre missing it, you can download it from the Google Play Store. Click start, tap security, and then device administration.
