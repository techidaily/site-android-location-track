## Part 2: How to Track A Cell Phone Location without Installing Software?

#### **How to Track a Cell Location using iCloud?**

Apple ships most of its phone with its Find My iPhone feature, for which to work, it will have t be activated on your target device before it goes astray. In most cases, you will have activated this feature already as soon as you unboxed the HTC U23 Pro device, but if you haven’t, here are a few steps to complete the process.

Step 1. From your iPhone, head to Settings, then tap your Apple ID, then iCloud, and lastly tap Find My iPhone to activate it.

![track a cell phone-activate Find My iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082095192265.jpeg)

Step 2. Once successfully activated, you can now track your iPhone’s whereabouts in Apple’s iCloud from any web browser.

Step 3. Go to iCloud.com, and then log in using your credentials.

Step 4. Click on the Find iPhone button located in the second row.

![track a cell phone-use Apple’s iCloud](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082095511390.jpeg)

Step 5. From here, you will need to click the dropdown labeled All Devices and select the target device. Once you select the HTC U23 Pro device you wish to locate, you can either erase your iPhone, send an audible alert or lock the HTC U23 Pro device.

![track a cell phone-select the HTC U23 Pro device you wish to locate](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082095893194.jpeg)

#### **How to Track a Cell Location using Android Device Manager?**

If you’re an Android user, Google’s Android Device Manager presently known as Find My Device is activated by default on newer cell phones. Note that if you have an older Android phone, you can download ADM right from the Google Play Store.

![track a cell phone-use Android Device Manager](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082096225606.jpg)

Step 1. As long as you have your Google account connected with your HTC U23 Pro (again something you will have done when you first received the phone), you can now begin tracking by heading to Find My Device on the web.

Step 2. Sign in with your Google credentials, and you will be greeted with a dashboard that will show you where your cell phone is along with several other options.

![track a cell phone-Sign in with your Google credentials](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082099019590.jpg)

Step 3. You can now do one of three things apart from viewing your cell location i.e. play sound, lock or erase device.

#### **Another Google Solution:**

Google recently has implemented some of the ADM features right into the web browser, meaning you can simply as the Search Giant to locate it for you from a simple web search. Of course, you will have to be logged into your Google account for this solution to work.

Step 1. Open the main Google search page and type in "find My HTC U23 Pro", and you should be presented with results showing your cell phone’s location.

## Part 3: How to Track a Cell Phone Location via mSpy?

We’ve just given you two solutions to how to track a cell phone location without installing software, but they are limited in the features they offer, meaning you can just check cell phone location. But there may be times when you may feel the need to get a comprehensive look or rather a mirror image of what your cell phone is being used for. And for that, there is [mSpy](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6), an app that allows you to not only track Your HTC U23 Pro location but rings in with several other handy features.

Billed as the ultimate software for parental control, [mSpy](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6) is compatible with Android, iOS, Windows PC and MAC OS and is easily accessible from any web browser. It is easy to install and if you experience any hiccups, you can always refer to the free online help. Further, it is available in several countries and backed by stellar multi-language customer support. mSpy offers three unique plans to choose from, each with its rich set of features that include the ability to manage calls, track text messages, read emails, track GPS location, monitor browsing history and internet use, control apps and programs and read instant messages from the app such as WhatsApp for a grand total of 24 features.

Step 1. After selecting the right plan for your needs, you will have to register the software.

![track a cell phone via mSpy-register the software](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082100202731.jpg)

Step 2. Next, you will have to set up the app with information on your target device and that’s it! You can now access the mSpy dashboard and begin tracking your cell phone location.

![track a cell phone via mSpy-setup the app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082100515661.jpg)

Step 3. You can select from several options in the left hand, two of the most noteworthy being geo-fencing and WhatsApp. Geo-fencing is a great feature to monitor both your kids and employees and basically, allows you to set up parameters and alert you when they are breached.

WhatsApp is a highly secure chat application, but mSpy backed by the latest technology also allows you to monitor its messages both incoming and outgoing. Simply click on the WhatsApp tab and you will be presented with a list of WhatsApp messages that you can further sort through by date.

There are several instances such as in the excitement of getting a new phone that we may overlook the need to install software to track a cell phone. But both Google and Apple are generous enough to offer a solution to track your cell phone location without having to install any third-party software. But if you’re like to do a lot more than just track your cell phone’s location, mSpy with its expensive list of features sets the gold standard in this space.
