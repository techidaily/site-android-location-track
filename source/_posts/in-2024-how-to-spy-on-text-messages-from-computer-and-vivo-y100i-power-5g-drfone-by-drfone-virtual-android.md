## How Do I Stop Someone From Tracking My Vivo Y100i Power 5G?

It has now become very easy to track a Smartphone using the GPS features of the phone. This can be done by tracking the phone number based on information derived from mobile carriers and also from the GPS chip on the phone which is used by certain apps in order to function well.

You may not want your GPS location tracked by anyone or by apps on your device. When playing games like Pokémon Go, the geo-location data on your device is used to pinpoint where you are for purposes of gameplay. In the same manner, malicious people can track you same way. Here you will learn how to stop someone from tracking your phone in simple and easy ways.

## Part 1: How do people track your phone?

There are several ways in which people can track the location of your phone. This can be risky at times, especially if you have a stalker. These are the common ways in which people track phones:

GPS location: all Smartphones come with a GPS chip, which continually gives the GPS location of your device. This is great for several features to work on the phone, but it can also be exploited by malicious people. The GPS location is also used to find lost devices or persons who are challenged in finding directions and may get lost. Therefore the GPS chip function is a double-edged sword.

IMEI information: This is information that can be tracked using data that is found on your mobile provider's servers. This is the information that law enforcers use to track crooks, and rescue teams use to track people lost in disaster zones. The IMEI gets recorded when your mobile device pings off mobile transmission towers that are nearby

The apps that are used by people to track mobile devices will track one of these two features. If you do not want to be tracked, then you have to find ways in which to disable these functions.

The sections below will show you how to stop someone from tracking your iPhone with ease.

## Part 1: How to Track lost iPhone for Free?

One of the noteworthy features of iPhones is that they tend to retain great value for many years to come hence they become a preferred choice for prying thieves. Further, they can be expensive for most budgets to begin with, so losing or misplacing your iPhone can cause a fair amount of heartache. Apple provides one of the best answers to how to track iPhones for free with its exclusive iCloud.

But before we move ahead and explain how to track your lost phone for free with iCloud, we should tell you that it is limited in its cell location tracking and other features in that it will only send a message to the Vivo Y100i Power 5G device, lock or erase it, and not provide records of information traffic going in and out of the Vivo Y100i Power 5G device. Here’s how to track lost iPhones for free.

Step 1. You will first need to ensure that the Find My iPhone feature is enabled on your device. This can be easily done by first launching the settings app on your iPhone, tapping on Apple ID at the top, and then iCloud and then Find My iPhone. Lastly, tab to enable it.
