## How Do I Stop Someone From Tracking My Poco X6 Pro?

It has now become very easy to track a Smartphone using the GPS features of the phone. This can be done by tracking the phone number based on information derived from mobile carriers and also from the GPS chip on the phone which is used by certain apps in order to function well.

You may not want your GPS location tracked by anyone or by apps on your device. When playing games like Pokémon Go, the geo-location data on your device is used to pinpoint where you are for purposes of gameplay. In the same manner, malicious people can track you same way. Here you will learn how to stop someone from tracking your phone in simple and easy ways.

## Part 1: How do people track your phone?

There are several ways in which people can track the location of your phone. This can be risky at times, especially if you have a stalker. These are the common ways in which people track phones:

GPS location: all Smartphones come with a GPS chip, which continually gives the GPS location of your device. This is great for several features to work on the phone, but it can also be exploited by malicious people. The GPS location is also used to find lost devices or persons who are challenged in finding directions and may get lost. Therefore the GPS chip function is a double-edged sword.

IMEI information: This is information that can be tracked using data that is found on your mobile provider's servers. This is the information that law enforcers use to track crooks, and rescue teams use to track people lost in disaster zones. The IMEI gets recorded when your mobile device pings off mobile transmission towers that are nearby

The apps that are used by people to track mobile devices will track one of these two features. If you do not want to be tracked, then you have to find ways in which to disable these functions.

The sections below will show you how to stop someone from tracking your iPhone with ease.

## How to Spy on Text Messages from Computer & Poco X6 Pro

Do you suspect that your child is communicating with the wrong individuals? While cellphones are meant to give everyone the ability to communicate, their secretive nature can also nurture society’s ills, and children, especially teenagers can fall prey to these. Yet, as a parent, it can be very hard to monitor what your child is doing on your device. That’s why we thought it wise to share with you a few ways you can spy on someone’s text messages from your device or computer.

## Part 1: How to Spy on text messages from another Android phone

To spy on another android device’s text messages, you will need to install spy software on that device. One of the best monitoring programs for the task is eyeZy. It is affordable, easy to install, and above all gives you access to the target device’s text messages remotely. [EyeZy](https://www.eyezy.com/) can also provide you with a wealth of other information about the target device including call history, browsing history, and even GPS location.

Here’s how to spy on another Android device’s text messages using eyeZy.

Step 1: The first step is to register for an eyeZy account on the eyeZy website. You can choose to purchase a 1 monthly/3 monthly/12 monthly subscription.

Step 2: Once you’ve registered and paid for your account, you will receive an email with all the information to help you download and install the software. The set-up wizard is very detailed and easy to follow.

Step 3: Once set up is complete, you can go to your eyeZy dashboard on any other Android device to begin monitoring the text messages on the target device.

## Part 2: How to Spy on text messages from another iPhone

For iPhone users, one of the best spy apps to use is Auto Forward. This app allows users to spy on another iPhone without the target device’s owner knowing. It has a major advantage in that it allows the user to see all messages including those the owner of the Poco X6 Pro device may have deleted. You can also see both sent and received messages.

Here’s how to use Auto Forward to spy on another iPhone’s text messages.

Step 1: To begin with, download and install Auto Forward onto your computer or another iOS device.

Step 2: Log in to your account (that you would have created before installing the app) and enter the Apple ID and password of the iPhone you want to spy on.

Step 3: The app will automatically access all messages on the target device. It will however only work if you have the target device’s Apple login details.
