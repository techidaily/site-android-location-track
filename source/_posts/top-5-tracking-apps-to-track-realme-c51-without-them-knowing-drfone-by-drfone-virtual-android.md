## Part 1: How to Track My Boyfriend's Phone via mSpy?

When I wanted to learn how can I track my boyfriend’s phone, I tried various third-party solutions. I tried [mSpy](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH96F) .

![track my boyfriend’s phone-via mSpy](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082599886089.jpg)

1\. To use mSpy, you need to visit its website right [here](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH96F) and create your new account. Ideally, you need to follow similar steps as KidsGuard Pro’s installation to use mSpy.

2\. After creating your mSpy account and getting a paid subscription, you need to access the target device.

Even though mSpy provides similar features to that of KidsGuard Pro, it only works on rooted (and jailbroken) devices.

Since KidsGuard Pro is compatible with all the leading Android and iOS devices, you can take its assistance without facing any setbacks. I used it to track my boyfriend’s phone and so can you. Nevertheless, before you proceed, make sure that you are not doing anything illegal. You should either own the phone you are tracking or inform the other person beforehand. This will prevent you from any unforeseen situation. Now when you know better, you can easily use KidsGuard Pro to track any Android or iOS device. Go ahead and give KidsGuard Pro a try and let us know about your experience in the comments below.
