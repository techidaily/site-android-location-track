If you have reason to suspect that someone might have access to your iPhone, it is important to take the steps to figure out just how they gained access to the Lava Yuva 3 device and how to eliminate the threat. This article will help you with both.

## Part 1: Can Someone Spy on my iPhone?

The biggest question most iPhone users have is; can someone spy on my iPhone? The truth is, it is actually quite easy to spy on an iPhone remotely thanks to the availability of many kinds of spy or monitoring programs. A hacker can also gain access to your device’s information through phishing websites. If you have ever seen those ads while browsing that tell you’ve won something spectacular even though you didn’t enter a competition, clicking on the ad often leads to a phishing website where your information could be severely compromised.

It is important to note that this can happen to anyone partly due to the sophisticated ways that hackers can infiltrate a device. Thanks to spying software, the person spying on your iPhone doesn’t even need to be a sophisticated hacker. They can be your spouse or employer.

## Part 2: How to Detect Spyware on iPhone?

The most logical step to take when you suspect that someone is spying on your iPhone is to take steps to detect the spyware. Once you are certain there is spyware on the Lava Yuva 3 device, you are in a position to do something about it. The problem is, detecting spyware can be next to impossible because such software is designed to remain undetectable. But there are several signs that your iPhone is compromised. The following are just some of the signs to look out for.

#### **1\. Data Usage Spikes**

Most spyware will use up your data to work. That’s because they have to receive the information every time you send a message or make a call. Therefore, one of the ways to check for spy activity on your device is to monitor data usage. If it’s above what you would normally use, you may have spyware.

#### **2\. The Cydia App**

The presence of the Cydia app on your device when you didn’t perform a jailbreak is another indicator of spyware. Do a Spotlight search for “Cydia” to see if you find it. But the Cydia app can be very difficult to detect because sometimes it can be hidden. To eliminate the possibility, enter “4433\*29342” into the spotlight search.

#### **3\. A warm iPhone**

Do you notice that your iPhone is warm even when you are not using it? If this happens, it is very likely that there is an app running in the background. Most spyware apps are designed to run in the background so this is a big indicator of spy activity.

#### **4\. Background Noises**

When you hear background noises during a call that have nothing to do with location, there may be active spyware on your device. This particularly happens when the spyware is there to monitor your phone calls.

## Part 3: How to Remove Spyware from iPhone?

Having a Spyware app on your device can be dangerous on many levels. Not only is the person spying on you violating your privacy, but they are also capable of getting vital information from your device like your address or bank information. Therefore, it is imperative that you take steps to remove the spyware o your device as soon as possible. The following are just some of the things you can do.

#### **1\. Install Anti-Spyware Program**

The best thing you can do is to install anti-spyware software on your device. These anti-spyware programs work by scanning the iPhone for spyware and deleting the programs. There are many such programs available but we advise to choose one with a reputation for efficiency. Anti-Spyware software will detect the spyware and ask you to uninstall it.

#### **2\. Update your iOS**
