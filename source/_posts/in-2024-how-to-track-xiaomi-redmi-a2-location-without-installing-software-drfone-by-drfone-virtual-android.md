This software functions silently and does not let your kid know that he/she is being monitored. To use this software:

Step 1. First of all, purchase a mSpy plan from its [official website](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6). Then buy a premium plan, provide your e-mail ID, set up mSpy, and create an account on which installation instructions will be sent.

Step 2. Next up, gain physical access to your kid’s Android/iPhone. Download the mSpy App on it. Once the App is downloaded, log in with the details sent to you in your e-mail. mSpy will never send any notifications to the target device and keeps the monitoring process absolutely discrete.

Step 3. Lastly, finish setting up mSpy by following the instructions on the e-mail to access your Control Panel. Then visit the web-based interface- Dashboard. When you’re at your Dashboard, start tracking and monitoring the target Android/iPhone remotely. Check the screenshots below to get a better idea.
