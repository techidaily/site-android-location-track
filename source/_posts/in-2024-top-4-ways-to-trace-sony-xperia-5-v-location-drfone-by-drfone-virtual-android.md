## Option 4: Google Maps (It will be available in the next version)

Introduction: This application is implementing new features for drivers to find parking more easily. It tries to help those forgetful drivers who park but then do not know where they parked the vehicle. For them, Maps is responsible for collecting information on the time in which they have been stopped after moving by car, if we have the mobile connected to the car by Bluetooth, the application understands that we have been using a vehicle, and shows the parking with a round blue icon with a capital P inside. If this does not appear, it can also be saved in another way. Once parked you can open the map of the application and click on the blue point of location. At that time it gives us the option to Save your parking leaving the blue icon mentioned above.

The second functionality of Google Maps in developing is the option to know where we can find available parking. In addition to the information collected by the application of our travels, it is able to show the most traveled places and with or greater parking so it can inform you where you are most likely to find parking. How does it work? A small red icon with a blank P appears next to the destination that we selected in our search. Next to the letter appears a text that indicates information about the parking in that zone.

Unfortunately, these options are not yet implemented on all Android and iOS smartphones. If our mobile phone does not yet have any of these features wait for the latest update as it is expected to be available on these operating systems very soon as a car locator device.

**Features:**

GPS locator for car

Shows available parking.

## Option 5: Waze

Introduction: This app, compatible with Android and iOS is intended for users who go by car.

It allows to obtain routes and check movements in real time, besides visualizing possible obstacles in your way.

The application goes beyond navigation because it permits drivers to share road reports on accidents, police checks or any other danger along their way and get information about what is coming also. It uses satellite technology, so it does not require internet. This application helps you to find parking areas when you need one and can be activated as a GPS locator for the car.

**Features:**

It is a car locator

Thanks to GPS you can find available parking

Get information in real-time if there is any problem in the way.

It is free and very easy to use.

So, now onwards, you do not need to pay to get a GPS locator for the car, as you can see, there are many available options that you can use and choose to locate your car for free for both iOS and Android devices. You can take our recommendations from these different options. Just connect your car with your device, does not matter it's operative system and start receiving information on where your car is and about the feasibility of parking area as well.
