## Part 1: How to Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak

The majority of spy apps in the market will only work on a jailbroken device or require you to jailbreak an iPhone before you can use them. While a jailbroken device does have its advantages, it can be quite problematic when you want to spy on an iPhone without alerting the owner to your activities. To begin with, you must have the iPhone to jailbreak it, a factor that makes it easier to get caught trying to spy on the Honor Magic 6 Pro device. Also, it is quite possible no matter how hard you try to hide the jailbreaking app that the owner will realize you have jailbroken their device.

For the best results you want to use a monitoring program that doesn’t require a jailbroken device to work.

## Part 2: How to Spy using Spyware that Requires a Jailbreak

Being able to spy on an iPhone without a jailbreak is not something that happens often. This is because unlike mSpy, most monitoring software will require you jailbreak the Honor Magic 6 Pro device before you can install the software. One of those apps is TruthSpy. Like mSpy, this app will allow users to see all types of data on the target device without the owner of the Honor Magic 6 Pro device knowing they are being monitored. The only problem is, you need to have access to the Honor Magic 6 Pro device to jailbreak it. If this is what you prefer or are unable to get access to mSpy, TruthSpy will work just fine. Here’s how to use it.

Step 1: Begin by performing a jailbreak on the target device. There are several options to help you do that like Pangu software.

![Spy using Spyware with jailbreak-Pangu software](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074779011456.jpg)

Step 2: Once the Honor Magic 6 Pro device is successfully jailbroken, create an account with TruthSpy, purchase a subscription and you will receive instructions on how to install the software on the jailbroken device.

Step 3: You can then log in to TurthSpy with your log in information and access all types of data on the target iPhone from any bowser.

![Spy using Spyware with jailbreak-log in to TurthSpy](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079742762274.jpg)

Both mSpy and TruthSpy will provide you with all the information you need about the target device. The only difference is, you need to jailbreak the Honor Magic 6 Pro device if TruthSpy will be able to access it. Jailbreaking the

device will however make it easier for the Honor Magic 6 Pro device’s owner to find the spyware and remove it before you are able to complete your activities. It is therefore preferable to use a program like mSpy that requires no jailbreak.



## How to Turn Off Google Location to Stop Tracking You on Honor Magic 6 Pro

The location services that Google provides to Android smartphones are indeed useful in many ways. For instance, you can use Google Maps to check a particular place you want to visit and obtain reliable directions to help you get there.

Indeed, Google’s GPS tracking feature comes in very handy whenever you need such assistance.

It’s true to say that Google's location monitoring services offer tons of benefits to us.

## Part 3. Keep Your Whereabouts Private With [<u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/)

Google surely understands that some users are uncomfortable sharing their whereabouts with the platform. That’s why you’re given the option to turn off Google location tracking on your Honor Magic 6 Pro smartphone. However, take note that doing so might gravely affect the functionality of some Google products. If you don’t want it to happen, there’s an alternative solution you can try. Rather than denying Google access to your location, why not change it instead and register a fake one? Yes. That can absolutely help you conceal your whereabouts without compromising the quality of Google services. Don’t worry. It’s a piece of cake. Wondershare Dr.Fone can help you a lot in this regard. It has a potent Virtual Location feature capable of modifying your whereabouts and simulating GPS movements. Do you want to try it now? Here’s a short guide for you.



**Step 1:** Download Wondershare Dr.Fone from its [<u>official website.</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) Subsequently, install it on your computer.

**Step 2:** Launch the newly installed software on your desktop. Once it fully loads up, connect your Honor Magic 6 Pro smartphone using a data cable. Follow the on-screen instructions to make sure that the connection between the two devices is stable enough to handle the succeeding procedures.

**Step 3:** Go to the left-side panel and then click **Toolbox.** On the main dashboard, click **Virtual Location.** Is it your first time accessing this feature? If so, Wondershare Dr.Fone will then download additional resources from the server. Don’t worry. The downloading process will only take a few minutes.

**Step 4:** After completing the downloading process, Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location will open in a separate window. From there, navigate to the top-right menu bar and then click **Teleport Mode.**

![wondershare drfone teleport mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png)

**Step 5:** Head over to the search bar at the top-left corner of the screen and then enter your desired location. Choose one from the suggestions that Wondershare Dr.Fone displays on the screen. Right after, click the **Enter** icon.

![enter your preferred location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

**Step 6:** The description of your chosen location will be then flashed on the screen. Read the details and make sure they are accurate. After that, click **Move Here** to proceed.

![read location description](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

**Step 7:** The location registered on your Honor Magic 6 Pro mobile device will now be replaced with your modified whereabouts. Verify the changes applied on your smartphone by checking Google Maps and searching for your current location. One way or another, it must show the altered result.

**NOTE:** If you want to restore your original location settings, simply disconnect your smartphone from the computer and restart it.

## Conclusion

At some point, we cannot deny that Google location services make our lives a lot more convenient. Imagine you can easily locate a particular place and get directions by simply browsing Google Maps. No need to borrow an Atlas from the library just to find a location you want to visit. However, in exchange for this convenience, you have to share location access with Google. Some users are not confident to access this privilege at the expense of their privacy. Don’t worry. That’s totally fine. If you’re one of them, this article can help you turn off Google location tracking on your Honor Magic 6 Pro. Is there a more conservative approach to address this issue? Luckily, there is. Download [<u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) on your computer and take advantage of its Virtual Location feature. It can help modify your whereabouts and simulate GPS movements without going outdoors.
