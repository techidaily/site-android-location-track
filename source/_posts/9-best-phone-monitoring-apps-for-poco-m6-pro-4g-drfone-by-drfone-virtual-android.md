## 4\. Caller ID & Number Locator

This app takes the cup for the day. With the phone number locator feature, it also comes with a call identifier.

With this, you can search and pinpoint the location of any mobile number or a fixed-line phone number in the world. This locator will run a database check to pull the exact location out for you, and moreover, it prints the same on the Google map to show you the target's phone's geographical location! Sounds cool, eh?

![phone number locator-Caller ID and Number Locator](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/11/15099056309953.jpg)

**Features**

- This software works through a database of added information on more than 12,982 cities.
- The call identifier feature will let you in on the real caller before you can answer the phone.
- There is also the option of a call blocker in case your caller gets too annoying to handle! (Or too offensive.)

**Pros**

- It doesn't necessarily require an Internet connection.
- This app has spread its wings over 200 countries globally.
- The location of the caller and the caller ID is viewable.
- With the caller blocker feature, it's possible to block any annoying caller.
- The availability of a Google map positioning technology makes it easier to pinpoint the exact location.

**Cons**

- It doesn't work on Android versions below 4.0.

## 5\. Truecaller

This is noted as the best leading app over the globe. There must be some better features compared to the previous ones if that's the case, yes?

It is cited to be the best caller ID app and it even blocks danger-rangers, their calls, and SMS. You can identify the person or the company that calls you before picking up. Be it landlines, mobile, or pre-paid even if you don't have the contact stored in your device!

You don't have to worry about telemarketers calling you or robocalls anymore. Spammers can't make an appearance ever again and consider yourself safe for life.

**Pros**

- Your phonebook contacts won't be uploaded online.

Where do you think these creators of number locators gather all this personal information from? It's absolutely frightening to think of how they would get hold of our information, isn't it? But, that's a topic for another day. It's certainly helpful if one doesn't misuse this information for their own personal gain now, right?
