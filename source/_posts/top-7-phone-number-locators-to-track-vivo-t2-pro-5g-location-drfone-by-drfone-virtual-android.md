## Part 2: How to Track Lost Android Mobile Location?

If you’ve misplaced your Vivo T2 Pro 5G cell phone, have no fear, because there are few ways to help you track its location. There are a few things to do before you can begin tracking an Android device such as have an active and connected Google account (something you already set up when you bought the Vivo T2 Pro 5G device), and locations services on the Vivo T2 Pro 5G device enabled.
