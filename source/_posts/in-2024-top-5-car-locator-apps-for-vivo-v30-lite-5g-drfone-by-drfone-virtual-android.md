It works by connecting our car with the mobile phone and allowing us to know at all times the location of our car, something very useful in case of missing or even theft. In addition, in case of an accident, we can notify the emergency services through the same application.

This app to find your car consists of a sensor connected to the mobile application and all we have to do is install it in the OBD (On Board Diagnostics) port of our vehicle, usually located next to the instrument control or around of the center console. It is available for iOS. Apart from looking for the car, this app allows us to control through Bluetooth also the consumption of gasoline, the effort that has made the engine, if you suffer and how to avoid it while advising us on how to achieve and maintain optimal driving.

## Option 4: Google Maps (It will be available in the next version)

Introduction: This application is implementing new features for drivers to find parking more easily. It tries to help those forgetful drivers who park but then do not know where they parked the vehicle. For them, Maps is responsible for collecting information on the time in which they have been stopped after moving by car, if we have the mobile connected to the car by Bluetooth, the application understands that we have been using a vehicle, and shows the parking with a round blue icon with a capital P inside. If this does not appear, it can also be saved in another way. Once parked you can open the map of the application and click on the blue point of location. At that time it gives us the option to Save your parking leaving the blue icon mentioned above.

The second functionality of Google Maps in developing is the option to know where we can find available parking. In addition to the information collected by the application of our travels, it is able to show the most traveled places and with or greater parking so it can inform you where you are most likely to find parking. How does it work? A small red icon with a blank P appears next to the destination that we selected in our search. Next to the letter appears a text that indicates information about the parking in that zone.

Unfortunately, these options are not yet implemented on all Android and iOS smartphones. If our mobile phone does not yet have any of these features wait for the latest update as it is expected to be available on these operating systems very soon as a car locator device.

**Features:**

GPS locator for car

Shows available parking.

## Part 1: Can I Track A Cell Phone with Just the Number?

We may not be aware of this but everyone can be controlled through their mobile phone. All the credit goes to science and the new technologies of information applied in modern society, and even governmental entities can know where you are at any moment through a cell phone number but the answer to the question about track phone by number is yes, you can.

Here, we need to mention that it depends upon the tool that you would use, whether it will work with the internet or it can provide location detail without internet access. The reason is that some of these applications need internet access to work online.

Also, each Android device is linked to a Google account, and the Internet giant offers a service called Device Manager. If you have enabled this service, then it is possible to track your mobile through the Gmail account from a computer or other devices. Also, in case of lost or stealth of an iPhone, using the “Search my iPhone” option/ app on our iOS devices, you can track the phone by number.
