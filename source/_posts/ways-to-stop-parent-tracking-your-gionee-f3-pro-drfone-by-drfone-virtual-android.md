## Part 1: How does the parent tracking tool work?

Many ways are used by the tracking tools to make sure that the children are always monitored. Some of the features include geo-fencing, app tracking, location, movements, and remote device locking. The page contents are also analyzed rather than database filtering to make sure that the Gionee F3 Pro devices get in remote control of the parents.

The other implementations that will be applied by such applications are keyword profanity and remote content locking as well. The two-factor authentication will also get more control to the parents and will allow them to capture the activities of the child with ease. If you want to know how to prevent the police from tracking your phone then it is advised to read this article thoroughly to get the best ideas.

## 1.1 Some apps that Parents use for Tracking and how these Work?

- **Qustodio –** It is one of the apps that is mostly used for tracking. The devices that are configured with it are Ma, iOS, and Android.
- **Kaspersky –** It comes with a premium price and creates a geo fencing which would not allow the child to browse freely. The activities are continuously monitored.
- **Circle Home Plus –** It monitors the home as well as the remote network that your child is using. The best thing is that it does not let your child know about the monitoring.
- **Net Nanny –** This is an application that parents use to monitor the child with web filters, screen recording, and app blocking features. It’s a bit pricy with all the features included.

### 1.2 Why Should We Prevent Parents from Tracking?

If you want to know how to stop your phone from being tracked by parents then it is important to know the reasons. If I consider myself as a child then I don’t think that I would like this idea one bit. Now, why should I prevent the parents from reaching out to My Gionee F3 Pro remotely?

- The children must feel that the parents trust them in full and they must not be a prying eye at all.
- Everyone has its privacy and it doesn’t feel good to meddle in matters at all regardless of age. Now when everything is involved in relationship tracking is not a good phenomenon.
- This also raises the anxiety level in the children as they get a feeling of constantly being watched. This is also something not good for a child’s health.

## Part 2: How to Change the Settings to Get Rid of Tracking?

For iOS users the process is simple and it does not require any additional installation at all. You just need to turn the location services OFF and you are done. Go to Settings > Privacy > Location Services > Toggle off the service.

![turn off location iPhone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/turn_off_location_iPhone.jpg)

The app is only so efficient if you got a miss call from the person on whom you want to do a little background snooping.

This app cannot trace Mobile Ported Numbers and it can only show the State Location of the caller.

Where do you think these creators of number locators gather all this personal information from? It's absolutely frightening to think of how they would get hold of our information, isn't it? But, that's a topic for another day. It's certainly helpful if one doesn't misuse this information for their own personal gain now, right?
