Step 3: You will be able to view the location details of your friends if they have enabled the location sharing on this app. You can find out the last location at the time of their recent login in this platform.

This method holds good only if the Facebook app has access to the location details of your friends. In case if any members have denied the location sharing option on this Facebook account then it is impossible to track the location using this method.
