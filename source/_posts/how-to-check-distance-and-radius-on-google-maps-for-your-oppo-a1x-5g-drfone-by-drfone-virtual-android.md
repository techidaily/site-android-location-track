## How to Check Distance and Radius on Google Maps For your Oppo A1x 5G

_“Is it possible to use Google Maps to calculate distance between multiple locations? I want to know the exact distance between different spots, but can’t seem to find any solution!”_

If you also wish to use the distance marker on Google Maps, then you might have a similar query like this. Apart from navigation, Google Maps can be used for different other applications as well. For instance, you can easily measure distance between two addresses on Google Maps. Besides that, you can also use the Google Maps distance radius feature to focus on a certain area. In this guide, I will let you know how to use Google location distance and radius features in detail.

## Part 1: Draw a Radius Circle on Google Maps

You might already know that Google Maps provides a map of the entire world for us to navigate. Though, there are times when users like to draw a radius on Google Maps for a particular location. Presently, the native feature of Google Maps does not have a distance radius tool. Therefore, to draw a radius on Google Maps, you would have to use an application that has its own interface. One of them is Map Developers that is based on Google Maps and has simply provided a solution to draw a radius on the map.

1. Firstly, just go to the official website of [Map Developers circle tool](https://www.mapdevelopers.com/draw-circle-tool.php) on any supported browser like Google Chrome. You can see that the website is based on Google Maps with its added layers to draw a radius on the map.

![google maps distance radius 2](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-2.jpg)

1. Now, just use the native feature of the map to zoom in to any location of your choice. You can also enter the name of the location that you are looking for in the search bar.
2. Besides that, you can also enter details about the radius of the circle, its color, and so on. After entering all the needed details, click on the “New Circle” button and it will be reflected on Google Maps interface.

![google maps distance radius 3](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-3.jpg)

If you want, you can later delete this circle or draw multiple circles in different colors to mark them in any location of your choice.

## Part 2: Determine the Distance with Radius on Google Maps

Apart from drawing a circle or radius on Google Maps, a lot of people would like to specify its distance as well. For instance, you might wish to specify a radius of specific miles or kilometers for a place on Google Maps. As stated above, the native feature of Google Maps is presently missing the distance radius feature. The good news is that there are tons of websites out there that have presented the same feature on the original layer of Google Maps.

- _Map Developers Radius_

Consider the example of the circle tool of Map Developers that we have discussed above. In this, you can just enter the name of a specific place on Google Maps. Now, you can specify the distance of radius in miles or kilometers. This will automatically draw the specific distance radius on Google Maps for the designated location.

- _KML Circle Generator_

If you know the exact longitude and latitude of the place, then you can also take the assistance of KML Circle Generator. In this, you would have to specify the exact coordinates of the place and the Google Maps distance radius value. After entering the relevant details, you can proceed and draw the radius distance on Google Maps.

## Part 3: Determine the Distance between two Addresses on Google Maps

This is one of the most resourceful features of Google Maps that a lot of people are not aware of. Using its native interface, you can find a straight line distance on Google Maps. That is, it won’t be the driving distance, but the exact distance between 2 places on Google Maps. If you want, you can add other spots to let Google Maps calculate distance between multiple locations as well. To learn how to measure distance between two addresses on Google Maps, follow these steps:

1. At first, just launch Google Maps on your system and go to the source location on it. You can click on any marked location or anywhere else on the map. Even if you click on any unmarked location, Google will load its coordinates for you.

![google maps distance radius 6](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-6.jpg)

1. Now, once the source location is identified, you need to right-click it to get its context menu. From the available options on the context menu, click on “Measure Distance”.

![google maps distance radius 7](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-7.jpg)

1. Afterward, just click anywhere else on the map and it will automatically find a straight line distance in Google Maps between these two spots.

![google maps distance radius 8](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-8.jpg)

1. If you want to continue, then just click anywhere else on the map and that will be considered as the next spot. Therefore, you can just click as many times as you want to let Google Maps calculate distance between multiple locations.

![google maps distance radius 9](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-9.jpg)

This technique will let you measure distance between any addresses on Google Maps. It doesn’t matter if it is your present location or not. If you want to measure distance in some other location, then just enter its name in the search bar to load it. In this way, you can measure distance anywhere in the world by sitting in your home.

This brings us to the end of this extensive guide on using Google Maps distance and radius features. As you can see, I have provided a smart and user-friendly solution to draw radius distance on Google Maps. Besides that, you can also follow the above guide to measure distance between two addresses on Google Maps. In the same way, you can also let Google Maps calculate distance between multiple locations as well. Go ahead and try these Google Maps distance and radius hacks and share your experience with us in the comments below.

This article will help you with both.

## Part 1: Can Someone Spy on my iPhone?

The biggest question most iPhone users have is; can someone spy on my iPhone? The truth is, it is actually quite easy to spy on an iPhone remotely thanks to the availability of many kinds of spy or monitoring programs. A hacker can also gain access to your device’s information through phishing websites. If you have ever seen those ads while browsing that tell you’ve won something spectacular even though you didn’t enter a competition, clicking on the ad often leads to a phishing website where your information could be severely compromised.

It is important to note that this can happen to anyone partly due to the sophisticated ways that hackers can infiltrate a device. Thanks to spying software, the person spying on your iPhone doesn’t even need to be a sophisticated hacker. They can be your spouse or employer.

## Part 2: How to Detect Spyware on iPhone?

The most logical step to take when you suspect that someone is spying on your iPhone is to take steps to detect the spyware. Once you are certain there is spyware on the Oppo A1x 5G device, you are in a position to do something about it. The problem is, detecting spyware can be next to impossible because such software is designed to remain undetectable. But there are several signs that your iPhone is compromised. The following are just some of the signs to look out for.

#### **1\. Data Usage Spikes**

Most spyware will use up your data to work. That’s because they have to receive the information every time you send a message or make a call. Therefore, one of the ways to check for spy activity on your device is to monitor data usage. If it’s above what you would normally use, you may have spyware.

#### **2\. The Cydia App**

The presence of the Cydia app on your device when you didn’t perform a jailbreak is another indicator of spyware. Do a Spotlight search for “Cydia” to see if you find it. But the Cydia app can be very difficult to detect because sometimes it can be hidden. To eliminate the possibility, enter “4433\*29342” into the spotlight search.

#### **3\. A warm iPhone**

Do you notice that your iPhone is warm even when you are not using it? If this happens, it is very likely that there is an app running in the background. Most spyware apps are designed to run in the background so this is a big indicator of spy activity.

#### **4\. Background Noises**

When you hear background noises during a call that have nothing to do with location, there may be active spyware on your device. This particularly happens when the spyware is there to monitor your phone calls.

## Part 3: How to Remove Spyware from iPhone?

Having a Spyware app on your device can be dangerous on many levels. Not only is the person spying on you violating your privacy, but they are also capable of getting vital information from your device like your address or bank information. Therefore, it is imperative that you take steps to remove the spyware o your device as soon as possible. The following are just some of the things you can do.

#### **1\. Install Anti-Spyware Program**

The best thing you can do is to install anti-spyware software on your device. These anti-spyware programs work by scanning the iPhone for spyware and deleting the programs. There are many such programs available but we advise to choose one with a reputation for efficiency. Anti-Spyware software will detect the spyware and ask you to uninstall it.

#### **2\. Update your iOS**

Another great way to get rid of spyware is to update your iOS. This is particularly helpful when you notice the Cydia app on your device and you didn’t jailbreak it. An update is effective because it often comes with bug fixes that may eliminate the spyware from your system.

To do it go to Settings > General > Software Update and tap “Download and Install.”

#### **3\. Restore your Device**

Restoring your iPhone in iTunes can also be quite effective in getting rid of spyware. Like an update, a restore often eliminates the spyware by deleting all bugs affecting the system. Be advised however that a restore will often erase all data and contents on the Oppo A1x 5G device so be sure to have a backup handy before doing this.

Considering how easy it is for someone to spy on you, the best thing you can do is remain vigilant. If you notice some of the signs we’ve mentioned in Part 2 above, take the necessary steps to remove the spyware. It is also important to avoid clicking on suspicious links especially in emails from people you don’t know.
