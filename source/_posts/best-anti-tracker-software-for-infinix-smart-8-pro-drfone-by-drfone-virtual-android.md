One way or another, anti-tracker software can be of great help to you. Check out the list of benefits below to understand it very well. For sure, the information provided below can guide you towards the best anti-tracking software options.

![sensitive information](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/anti-tracker-software-2.JPG)

In today’s digital era, where identity theft is rampant everywhere, privacy matters the most. Keeping our personal data away from public access is the least we can do to protect ourselves. That’s why you should consider installing anti-tracker software on your devices. Somehow, it can give you an assurance that the sensitive information you share online is not out in the open.

What happens if hackers get their hands on your browsing history? Well, there are lots of possibilities, and most of them can directly affect you.

Hackers sell it to them, along with other sensitive information embedded in your browser. Of course, nobody wants that. It’s clearly an invasion of privacy. Therefore, install anti-tracker software on your device to prevent this kind of situation from happening.

### It prevents advertisers from using your private information

It is nice if the ads that show up while we’re browsing include products we’re personally interested in. Hence, we cannot deny that giving legitimate advertisers access to our preferences is somehow beneficial to a certain degree. However, there are some third-party affiliates that are quite aggressive in tracking our browsing data. We should get rid of that the moment we spot them red-handed. It’s best to use anti-tracker software just to be sure.

### It protects us from internet scams

## 1.1 Some apps that Parents use for Tracking and how these Work?

- **Qustodio –** It is one of the apps that is mostly used for tracking. The devices that are configured with it are Ma, iOS, and Android.
- **Kaspersky –** It comes with a premium price and creates a geo fencing which would not allow the child to browse freely. The activities are continuously monitored.
- **Circle Home Plus –** It monitors the home as well as the remote network that your child is using. The best thing is that it does not let your child know about the monitoring.
- **Net Nanny –** This is an application that parents use to monitor the child with web filters, screen recording, and app blocking features. It’s a bit pricy with all the features included.

### 1.2 Why Should We Prevent Parents from Tracking?

If you want to know how to stop your phone from being tracked by parents then it is important to know the reasons. If I consider myself as a child then I don’t think that I would like this idea one bit. Now, why should I prevent the parents from reaching out to My Infinix Smart 8 Pro remotely?

- The children must feel that the parents trust them in full and they must not be a prying eye at all.
- Everyone has its privacy and it doesn’t feel good to meddle in matters at all regardless of age. Now when everything is involved in relationship tracking is not a good phenomenon.
- This also raises the anxiety level in the children as they get a feeling of constantly being watched. This is also something not good for a child’s health.
