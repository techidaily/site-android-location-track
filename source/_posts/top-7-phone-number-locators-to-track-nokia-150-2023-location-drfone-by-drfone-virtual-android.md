Further, they can be expensive for most budgets to begin with, so losing or misplacing your iPhone can cause a fair amount of heartache. Apple provides one of the best answers to how to track iPhones for free with its exclusive iCloud.

But before we move ahead and explain how to track your lost phone for free with iCloud, we should tell you that it is limited in its cell location tracking and other features in that it will only send a message to the Nokia 150 (2023) device, lock or erase it, and not provide records of information traffic going in and out of the Nokia 150 (2023) device. Here’s how to track lost iPhones for free.

Step 1. You will first need to ensure that the Find My iPhone feature is enabled on your device. This can be easily done by first launching the settings app on your iPhone, tapping on Apple ID at the top, and then iCloud and then Find My iPhone. Lastly, tab to enable it.

Step 2. Now it’s time to hit the cloud—iCloud we mean! First things first—head to <www.iCloud.com> from any browser and login with your credentials. From the dashboard, click on Find iPhone in the second row and enter your Apple ID and password if prompted. Since you may have several Apple devices connected with the same iCloud account, click on All Devices at the top, and select the Nokia 150 (2023) device you wish to track from the dropdown.

## Part 2: How to Track Lost Android Mobile Location?

If you’ve misplaced your Nokia 150 (2023) cell phone, have no fear, because there are few ways to help you track its location. There are a few things to do before you can begin tracking an Android device such as have an active and connected Google account (something you already set up when you bought the Nokia 150 (2023) device), and locations services on the Nokia 150 (2023) device enabled. Even though your mobile manufacturer may offer their own exclusive solution to track your phone, Google’s Find My Device (formerly Android Device Manager) is probably the most easiest and trusted way to go with. Here’s how to track your lost phone with Google’s ADM.

Step 1. Most latest Android phones are already equipped with the Find My Service, but if you’re missing it, you can download it from the Google Play Store. Click start, tap security, and then device administration.
