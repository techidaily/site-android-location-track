## Part 1: How to Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak

The majority of spy apps in the market will only work on a jailbroken device or require you to jailbreak an iPhone before you can use them. While a jailbroken device does have its advantages, it can be quite problematic when you want to spy on an iPhone without alerting the owner to your activities. To begin with, you must have the iPhone to jailbreak it, a factor that makes it easier to get caught trying to spy on the Oppo A79 5G device. Also, it is quite possible no matter how hard you try to hide the jailbreaking app that the owner will realize you have jailbroken their device.

For the best results you want to use a monitoring program that doesn’t require a jailbroken device to work. The best is [mSpy](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6), a monitoring program that will work on any iPhone and provide you with detailed information without the need to jailbreak the Oppo A79 5G device. Here’s how to use mSpy to spy on an iPhone.

Step 1: Begin by activating iCloud Backup on the target device. Go to Settings and then select “iCloud” to do this. Using mSpy will require iCloud to be activated.

![Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak-activate iCloud Backup](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079744896475.jpg)

Step 2: The first step is to create an account with mSpy. You can then purchase a subscription based on the type of information you need from the target device and the duration you want to spend spying on the Oppo A79 5G device.

![Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak-create an account with mSpy](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079746911961.jpg)

Step 3: Once you’ve registered and purchased the subscription, you will receive an email from mSpy with all the information you need to install the program.

Step 4: You can then log in to your [mSpy](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6) control panel and add the Apple ID and password of the Oppo A79 5G device to gain access to the information you need on the Oppo A79 5G device.

## Part 2: How to Spy using Spyware that Requires a Jailbreak

Being able to spy on an iPhone without a jailbreak is not something that happens often. This is because unlike mSpy, most monitoring software will require you jailbreak the Oppo A79 5G device before you can install the software. One of those apps is TruthSpy. Like mSpy, this app will allow users to see all types of data on the target device without the owner of the Oppo A79 5G device knowing they are being monitored. The only problem is, you need to have access to the Oppo A79 5G device to jailbreak it. If this is what you prefer or are unable to get access to mSpy, TruthSpy will work just fine. Here’s how to use it.

Step 1: Begin by performing a jailbreak on the target device. There are several options to help you do that like Pangu software.

![Spy using Spyware with jailbreak-Pangu software](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074779011456.jpg)

Step 2: Once the Oppo A79 5G device is successfully jailbroken, create an account with TruthSpy, purchase a subscription and you will receive instructions on how to install the software on the jailbroken device.

Step 3: You can then log in to TurthSpy with your log in information and access all types of data on the target iPhone from any bowser.

![Spy using Spyware with jailbreak-log in to TurthSpy](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079742762274.jpg)

Both mSpy and TruthSpy will provide you with all the information you need about the target device. The only difference is, you need to jailbreak the Oppo A79 5G device if TruthSpy will be able to access it. Jailbreaking the

device will however make it easier for the Oppo A79 5G device’s owner to find the spyware and remove it before you are able to complete your activities. It is therefore preferable to use a program like mSpy that requires no jailbreak.

## Part 1: How to know whether your text message has been intercepted?

Intercepting a target phone could give us the controls and allow us to spy on various activities happening on the target phone even to the extent of giving us information about what’s happening in the surrounding. It does this by listening to the conversation by turning on the microphone even when the target phone is not in use. So, while the spying application keeps running in the background silently, text messages can be easily intercepted. So, it is imperative to know and read the signs to actually get to know if your text messages are being intercepted. There are some signs which could give you an idea if your text message has been intercepted.

**Odd Phone Behavior** – If your phone is behaving erratic and lights up suddenly even when not in use, it is possible that the cell phone is being intercepted. Some other signs could be random beeping noise, phone shutting down by itself, etc. While this might happen normally at times, if it is happening on a regular basis, there is a chance that the phone text message or for that matter phone data is being intercepted.

**Battery Rundown** – Some spy software running in the background can consume a lot of battery charge. If there is a dramatic change in the battery consumption and the phone now needs charging more often, it might mean that text messages or the phone is being intercepted.

**Phone Shuts down** – If your phone regularly shuts down by itself, even if the battery is fully charged, there could be one spy application running on the phone.

**Increased data usage** – If you see a dramatic increase in the consumption of data, it could be due to the spy application running silently in the background. The spy applications constantly send the recorded text message logs and data from the target phone which increases data consumption.

So, these are some signs which could suggest that your text message has been intercepted.

Intercepting text messages is now very easy using a robust application which can intercept any device in some simple steps. Moreover, the application can be used with both iOS and Android devices.

## Part 2: Intercepting text messages from both iOS and Android phones

**mSpy:**

## Part 3: What you need to know when using mSpy

**Few things to know when using [mSpy](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6):**

While the working, installation, and setting up of mSpy is very easy, there are a few things that need to be kept in mind while using mSpy.

1\. While it is possible to remotely access data, monitor, and control the target device, it is imperative to have physical access to the target device to install the application, grant permissions, and set the application up. This is a one-time task that needs to be done before you start accessing the target device records remotely from other devices using the browser.

2\. If the target device is iPhone or iPad, the target device must be jailbroken for mSpy to be used.

3\. The target device must be connected to the internet. mSpy will constantly send information pertaining to text messages or SMS, call logs, WhatsApp messages, etc from the target device to the control panel while it is connected to the internet.
