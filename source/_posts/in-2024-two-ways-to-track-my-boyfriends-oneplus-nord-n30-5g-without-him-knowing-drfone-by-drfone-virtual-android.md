## Two Ways to Track My Boyfriend's OnePlus Nord N30 5G without Him Knowing

How can I track my boyfriend’s phone? If you also have the same question, then this would be the last post you’ll read. A while back, I was a little suspicious of my boyfriend’s behavior and wanted to track my boyfriend’s phone. As I did some research, I discovered that even though there are lots of spying tools out there, only a handful of them yields the desired results. I handpicked two apps to track my boyfriend and they certainly met my expectations. Therefore, I have provided a stepwise tutorial to use them right here.

## Part 1: How to Track My Boyfriend's Phone via mSpy?

When I wanted to learn how can I track my boyfriend’s phone, I tried various third-party solutions. I tried [mSpy](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH96F) .

![track my boyfriend’s phone-via mSpy](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082599886089.jpg)

1\. To use mSpy, you need to visit its website right [here](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH96F) and create your new account. Ideally, you need to follow similar steps as KidsGuard Pro’s installation to use mSpy.

2\. After creating your mSpy account and getting a paid subscription, you need to access the target device.

3\. Go to its Settings > Security and make sure that the option of downloading from Unknown Sources is turned on.

4\. Afterward, you can go to its website and download the app.

5\. Install and perform the setup of the app with your own account credentials.

6\. Once it is done, you can access its web-based dashboard remotely and gain all the needed information related to the target device.

Even though mSpy provides similar features to that of KidsGuard Pro, it only works on rooted (and jailbroken) devices. Additionally, it is comparatively more expensive than KidsGuard Pro and doesn’t truly have a full-invisible mode. Any smart user can detect the spying app, which might land you in trouble.

## Part 2: How to Track My Boyfriend's Phone via KidsGuard Pro?

As I wanted to learn how can I track my boyfriend’s phone, I stumbled upon an amazing tool – [KidsGuard Pro](https://www.clevguard.com/android-parental-control/). It provided a highly reliable and secure way to track a device’s location, its vital content, and so much more. Easy to download and use, KidsGuard Pro doesn’t require you to root your OnePlus Nord N30 5G. After installing it on the target device, you can track it from the web dashboard control panel remotely.

Since it runs in stealth mode, it allowed me to track my boyfriend’s phone without getting detected. Besides his real-time location, I was able to know his call logs, contacts, photos, social media activity, and so much more in one place. It allowed me to track my boyfriend in a trouble-free manner. You can also do the same by following these steps:

1\. Firstly, visit KidsGuard Pro’s official website right [here](https://panel.clevguard.com/sign-up?dev_tp=android) and create your new account. You need to sign-up with your email id and set up a strong password.

![track my boyfriend’s phone-sign up KidsGuard Pro ](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/create-an-account-for-clevguard.jpg)

2\. Secondly, after buying the product, you need to download the KidsGuard Pro app on your target device. Please go to the My Products and Orders Management page and click "Setup Guide" to follow the instructions carefully and complete all settings on the target device.

![complete the settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/click-android-setup-guide.jpg)

3\. Great! Now all you need to do is log in to your KidsGuard Pro account on their website using your account credentials. On the home page, you can access all the major information related to the OnePlus Nord N30 5G device like its location, frequent callers, and more.

4\. Furthermore, you can simply visit the desired section from the left panel to get in-depth access. For instance, by visiting the “Locations” section, you can view the real-time location of the OnePlus Nord N30 5G device, the previously visited places, and more.

After following these instructions, I was also able to track my boyfriend without much trouble. KidsGuard Pro also provides a seamless way to track the social media activity on the target device, record calls, listen to its surroundings, etc. Furthermore, you can enable its Keylogging feature as well to get a comprehensive record of everything typed on the OnePlus Nord N30 5G device.

## How Do I Stop Someone From Tracking My OnePlus Nord N30 5G?

It has now become very easy to track a Smartphone using the GPS features of the phone. This can be done by tracking the phone number based on information derived from mobile carriers and also from the GPS chip on the phone which is used by certain apps in order to function well.

You may not want your GPS location tracked by anyone or by apps on your device. When playing games like Pokémon Go, the geo-location data on your device is used to pinpoint where you are for purposes of gameplay. In the same manner, malicious people can track you same way. Here you will learn how to stop someone from tracking your phone in simple and easy ways.

## Part 1: How do people track your phone?

There are several ways in which people can track the location of your phone. This can be risky at times, especially if you have a stalker. These are the common ways in which people track phones:

GPS location: all Smartphones come with a GPS chip, which continually gives the GPS location of your device. This is great for several features to work on the phone, but it can also be exploited by malicious people. The GPS location is also used to find lost devices or persons who are challenged in finding directions and may get lost. Therefore the GPS chip function is a double-edged sword.

IMEI information: This is information that can be tracked using data that is found on your mobile provider's servers. This is the information that law enforcers use to track crooks, and rescue teams use to track people lost in disaster zones. The IMEI gets recorded when your mobile device pings off mobile transmission towers that are nearby

The apps that are used by people to track mobile devices will track one of these two features. If you do not want to be tracked, then you have to find ways in which to disable these functions.

The sections below will show you how to stop someone from tracking your iPhone with ease.
