## Part 3: An Alternative: Try mSpy

Taking pictures and videos discreetly from your spy watch may seem grand and fanciful, like 007. But real spy work actually happens behind a computer screen. In the age of information technology, people keep all their most valuable information stored on phones. As such, if you have access to someone's phone, you have access to all their secrets. However, breaking into someone's phone doesn't require years of hacking and coding practice as most people believe. All you need is a decent app that can take care of everything for you. [mSpy](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6) is that app.

While there are a lot of other spy apps out there worth browsing through, both for Android and [iPhone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/track/iphone-monitoring.html), mSpy is the most reliable, reasonable, and feature-heavy of them all.

## How Do I Stop Someone From Tracking My Vivo Y100i?

It has now become very easy to track a Smartphone using the GPS features of the phone. This can be done by tracking the phone number based on information derived from mobile carriers and also from the GPS chip on the phone which is used by certain apps in order to function well.

You may not want your GPS location tracked by anyone or by apps on your device. When playing games like Pokémon Go, the geo-location data on your device is used to pinpoint where you are for purposes of gameplay. In the same manner, malicious people can track you same way. Here you will learn how to stop someone from tracking your phone in simple and easy ways.

## Part 1: How do people track your phone?

There are several ways in which people can track the location of your phone. This can be risky at times, especially if you have a stalker. These are the common ways in which people track phones:

GPS location: all Smartphones come with a GPS chip, which continually gives the GPS location of your device. This is great for several features to work on the phone, but it can also be exploited by malicious people. The GPS location is also used to find lost devices or persons who are challenged in finding directions and may get lost. Therefore the GPS chip function is a double-edged sword.

IMEI information: This is information that can be tracked using data that is found on your mobile provider's servers. This is the information that law enforcers use to track crooks, and rescue teams use to track people lost in disaster zones. The IMEI gets recorded when your mobile device pings off mobile transmission towers that are nearby

The apps that are used by people to track mobile devices will track one of these two features. If you do not want to be tracked, then you have to find ways in which to disable these functions.

The sections below will show you how to stop someone from tracking your iPhone with ease.

## Part 2: How to stop my iPhone from being tracked?

## Part 3:How to stop my android from being tracked

You also need to know how to stop Google from tracking your Vivo Y100i. This feature can be used to track your device through other apps.

### 1) Stop Google Tracking on Android device

- Access the "settings" app on your Home screen
- Now check your accounts until you find the "Google Account" option
- Tap on it and then scroll down to the "Manage Your Data & Personalization" option and tap on it
- You will find "Activity Controls" where you can pause or turn off the service altogether.
- If you want tighter control of the tracking features, You can also scroll down until you get to "Manage Your Activity Controls"
- Here you can delete all your past activity records so nobody can track you using your location history.

### 2) Turn off Android Location Tracking

Apart from stopping Google tracking on your device, you may also turn off Location tracking of other apps as shown below

- Start by going to your "Settings" app and then choosing "Security & Location"
- Scroll around and look for the "Use Location" option and then toggle it to the "OFF" position

Many people would stop at this time and think that their location is fully turned off, but this is not the case. The Android device could still be tracked using IMEI, Wi-Fi, and many other sensors. To disable these, go to the "advanced" option and then toggle off the following features:

Google Emergency Location Service. This is a service that tells emergency services where you are located when you dial the emergency service number.

Google Location Accuracy. This is a GPS feature that uses the Wi-Fi address and other services to show your location.

Google Location History. With this, you can switch off the collection of your location history.

Google Location Sharing. This will turn off location sharing if you use it to connect with friends and family.

## 5 Ways to Track Vivo Y100i without App

The Find My Vivo Y100i app is a great addition to your iPhone, and as the name suggests helps you to not only track your phone in the event it is stolen, but also lock it so that it cannot be misused. But what if you don’ have the app installed? Does that mean that you have to bid adieu to your iPhone forever? Not really, because we are about to reveal to you 5 different ways to track your iPhone without app, so you can hopefully find your phone in the condition it went astray.

## Part 1: Solution 1 – Apple’s iCloud to the rescue

Take note that this solution will not work if you haven’t activated the Find My iPhone service when you set up your device. If you have, here’s how to go about it.

Step 1. Get started by heading over to iCloud, and logging in with your credentials.

![sign in to iCloud](https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/article/2017/10/icloud.com-login.jpg)

If you are greeted with the two factor authentication process, which asks you to insert a code that was sent to your devices, you can simply skip it by heading to the quick access link at the bottom.

![skip the two factor authentication process](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075180348414.jpg) ![head to the quick access link](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075180363658.jpg)

Step 2. From the dashboard, locate the Find iPhone icon on the second row and click on it.

![locate the Find iPhone icon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075181495657.jpg)

Step 3. Hover over to the All Devices dropdown menu and choose your iPhone.

![choose your iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075181861335.jpg)

Step 4. The tracking process will now begin, and you should be able to see it displayed on an interactive map if successful.

Step 5. Once you know the exact location of your device, you can do one of three things—activate lost mode, trigger an acoustic signal or erase all data.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Part 2: Solution 2 - Google to the Rescue

Note that this solution will only work if you have Location Services enabled on your iPhone.

It’s no surprise that both Apple and the search giant are fond of gathering information on all sorts of things, most notably your location. Google stores this information on its Timeline, so without ado, head to the Google Timeline.

![head to the Google Timeline to track your iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/example-trip-google-timeline.png)

Step 2. Select the present date from the left hand panel.

Step 3. Scroll to the bottom of the timeline, and select the latest location update.

Step 4. If your location is the same as your previous updates, your phone hasn’t moved so you go and get it from that location. Contrarily, if your phone has moved, you should contact authorities, and not go after the thief alone because you never know the type of person they are.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Part 3: Solution 3 - Using Google Photos to Track your iPhone

If the above Google features do not work for you, the search giant has one more service that can help aka Google Photos.

This option is somewhat complex, and requires that you have the Google Photos app installed with automatic upload turned on. Further, someone will have to take photos with your iPhone, and in the event it is actually stolen, this is highly unlikely.

Well, if you have the aforementioned prerequisites, head over to photos.google.com to visit your most recently uploaded photos. If you happen to notice any recent photos, click on them and check their location by clicking on the right sidebar. Again, if you do find the location using this method, it is best to contact your local authorities.

## Part 4: Solution 4. Have another iPhone? Use it to Track one that’s gone missing

This method requires that you have Find My Friend enabled on both your missing iPhone and the one you’re going to use to track it. Good news is that starting from iOS 9, this feature is stock and will already be installed on the Vivo Y100i device.

Step 1. Open the Find My Friends app on the iPhone that you will use for the tracking, and then enable Share My Location by tapping on their contact picture located at the bottom.

Ensure that the location is being Shared From This Device as there may be other devices connected with the same iCloud account.

Step 2. Next enable AirDrop from the control center of your iPhone and make yourself discoverable to everyone. Further hit Add on the tracking iPhone, choose your contact icon and select Share Indefinitely.

Step 3. Once the tracking iPhone’s location is shared with your device, a popup will appear asking you how long you would like to share your location for, which is where you select Share Indefinitely.

![use another phone to track the missing one](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075192666907.jpg)

Step 4. When you’re ready to begin tracking, open up the Find My Friends app, click on their contact (your contact in this case) to see its exact location in real time.
