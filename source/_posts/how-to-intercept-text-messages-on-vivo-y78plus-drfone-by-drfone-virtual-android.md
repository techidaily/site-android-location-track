## Part 1: How to know whether your text message has been intercepted?

Intercepting a target phone could give us the controls and allow us to spy on various activities happening on the target phone even to the extent of giving us information about what’s happening in the surrounding. It does this by listening to the conversation by turning on the microphone even when the target phone is not in use. So, while the spying application keeps running in the background silently, text messages can be easily intercepted. So, it is imperative to know and read the signs to actually get to know if your text messages are being intercepted. There are some signs which could give you an idea if your text message has been intercepted.

**Odd Phone Behavior** – If your phone is behaving erratic and lights up suddenly even when not in use, it is possible that the cell phone is being intercepted. Some other signs could be random beeping noise, phone shutting down by itself, etc. While this might happen normally at times, if it is happening on a regular basis, there is a chance that the phone text message or for that matter phone data is being intercepted.

**Battery Rundown** – Some spy software running in the background can consume a lot of battery charge. If there is a dramatic change in the battery consumption and the phone now needs charging more often, it might mean that text messages or the phone is being intercepted.

**Phone Shuts down** – If your phone regularly shuts down by itself, even if the battery is fully charged, there could be one spy application running on the phone.

**Increased data usage** – If you see a dramatic increase in the consumption of data, it could be due to the spy application running silently in the background. The spy applications constantly send the recorded text message logs and data from the target phone which increases data consumption.

So, these are some signs which could suggest that your text message has been intercepted.

Intercepting text messages is now very easy using a robust application which can intercept any device in some simple steps. Moreover, the application can be used with both iOS and Android devices.

## 4\. Caller ID & Number Locator

This app takes the cup for the day. With the phone number locator feature, it also comes with a call identifier.

With this, you can search and pinpoint the location of any mobile number or a fixed-line phone number in the world. This locator will run a database check to pull the exact location out for you, and moreover, it prints the same on the Google map to show you the target's phone's geographical location! Sounds cool, eh?

## 5\. Truecaller

This is noted as the best leading app over the globe. There must be some better features compared to the previous ones if that's the case, yes?

It is cited to be the best caller ID app and it even blocks danger-rangers, their calls, and SMS. You can identify the person or the company that calls you before picking up. Be it landlines, mobile, or pre-paid even if you don't have the contact stored in your device!

You don't have to worry about telemarketers calling you or robocalls anymore. Spammers can't make an appearance ever again and consider yourself safe for life.

Where do you think these creators of number locators gather all this personal information from? It's absolutely frightening to think of how they would get hold of our information, isn't it? But, that's a topic for another day. It's certainly helpful if one doesn't misuse this information for their own personal gain now, right?
