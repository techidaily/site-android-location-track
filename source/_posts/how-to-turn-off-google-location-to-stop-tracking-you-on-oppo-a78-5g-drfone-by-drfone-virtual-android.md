## Part 1. Understanding How Google Uses Location Data

Location data generally helps us find reliable directions and pinpoint a particular place. But apart from that, this piece of information actually serves a bigger purpose. Google, in particular, employs location data to provide high-quality services tailored to specific preferences and necessities of the users. Each Google product relies heavily on location information and utilizes it for various reasons. To understand it better, check out the list below.

![google products](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-1.JPG)

Of course, Google Maps and Weather will not work without access to location data. It is the main component that allows this kind of application to function exactly as it should. That’s why you should think twice before you turn off Google location tracking. Keep it activated on your mobile device if you’re in need of real-time weather updates or reliable coordinates.

### It is used for targeted advertisements

The majority of online advertisements scattered all over the internet are run by Google. It uses location data to ensure the ads that appear on your web browser are relevant to your personal liking. For example, Google Ads will likely flash American products on your smartphones if you’re located in that particular region. Do you want to keep it that way? If so, you should not then turn off Google location tracking on your Oppo A78 5G smartphone.

### It is used by Google to provide accurate search results

![google search results](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-2.JPG)

The same thing goes for Google search results. This query engine uses location data to provide information relevant to the specific needs of the user. Let’s say you’re currently residing in Japan and looking for nearby coffee shops. Of course, it will be unhelpful if Google dispenses a list of coffee shops that aren’t located in your country. That’s why you shouldn’t turn off Google location tracking on your smartphone if you’re looking for precise and pertinent answers.

### It is used by Google to implement certain security protocols

Google uses location data to keep your accounts safe from potential attacks and security breaches. How so? Well, Google immediately sends alerts whenever your account is used from an unusual location. Another thing is that strange activities on your account are promptly detected with the aid of location information. Simply put, allowing Google to access your whereabouts is the least you can do to protect your digital assets. Hence, don’t turn off Google location tracking on your Oppo A78 5G smartphone if you need such assistance.

![google services](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-3.JPG)

We all know that Google is committed to offering us new products and improving its existing services. That’s indeed beneficial to all of us, especially in today’s ever-changing world. But definitely, it’s not possible if Google doesn’t have adequate location information from the pool of its users. Why so? Simply because location data determines the latest community trends and helps specialists find the perfect basis for fresh developments. Do you want to contribute something to the advancement of Google products? If so, you can start by giving Google access to the location data on your Oppo A78 5G smartphone.

Yes, it is a matter of minutes now to be able to spy on or intercept text messages even when not having the target device in your possession.

![fake GPS of mobile device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

## Part 1: How to know whether your text message has been intercepted?

Intercepting a target phone could give us the controls and allow us to spy on various activities happening on the target phone even to the extent of giving us information about what’s happening in the surrounding. It does this by listening to the conversation by turning on the microphone even when the target phone is not in use. So, while the spying application keeps running in the background silently, text messages can be easily intercepted. So, it is imperative to know and read the signs to actually get to know if your text messages are being intercepted. There are some signs which could give you an idea if your text message has been intercepted.

**Odd Phone Behavior** – If your phone is behaving erratic and lights up suddenly even when not in use, it is possible that the cell phone is being intercepted. Some other signs could be random beeping noise, phone shutting down by itself, etc. While this might happen normally at times, if it is happening on a regular basis, there is a chance that the phone text message or for that matter phone data is being intercepted.

**Battery Rundown** – Some spy software running in the background can consume a lot of battery charge. If there is a dramatic change in the battery consumption and the phone now needs charging more often, it might mean that text messages or the phone is being intercepted.

**Phone Shuts down** – If your phone regularly shuts down by itself, even if the battery is fully charged, there could be one spy application running on the phone.

**Increased data usage** – If you see a dramatic increase in the consumption of data, it could be due to the spy application running silently in the background. The spy applications constantly send the recorded text message logs and data from the target phone which increases data consumption.

So, these are some signs which could suggest that your text message has been intercepted.

Intercepting text messages is now very easy using a robust application which can intercept any device in some simple steps. Moreover, the application can be used with both iOS and Android devices.

## Part 2: Intercepting text messages from both iOS and Android phones

Moreover, mSpy also gives information about call logs and contacts along with access to the IM chats like WhatsApp monitoring, Snapchat monitoring, etc. mSpy also allows you to view the photos and videos taken or stored or just viewed on the target device. mSpy can remotely erase the targeted phone’s data. This feature helps when the phone is stolen. Installing mSpy on the target phone is extremely simple and involves very few steps. So, it takes a few minutes to install the application on the target phone. mSpy works with iPhone as well as Android phones. So, text message interception is possible with both iPhone and Android using mSpy.

**Using mSpy to intercept text messages from other phones**

To be able to intercept text messages from other phones, it is first required to install the mSpy application on the target phone that has to be intercepted. Here are some steps to intercept text messages using mSpy from other phones:

**1\. Install mSpy and set it up**
