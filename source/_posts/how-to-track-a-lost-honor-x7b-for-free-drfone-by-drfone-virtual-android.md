## How to Track a Lost Honor X7b for Free?

A cell phone is a rather small device when compared to other things you may haul around on a daily basis such as a purse or wallet and even a bunch of keys. Hence, forgetting it somewhere or having it stolen is highly likely. However, with the increase in modern mobile technology, there are several apps that can help you track your lost cell phone’s whereabouts. But you’ve already paid a premium price for your cell phone, so what you really should do is learn how to track a lost phone for free?

And if you haven’t done so already, you should also install apps whether paid or free that do more than GPS location tracking such as monitoring incoming and outgoing calls, text and multimedia messages. So if you’re wondering how to track your lost phone for free, we’ve got a few solutions that will help you do just that, and others that bring to the table a wide range of great features.

## Part 1: How to Track lost iPhone for Free?

One of the noteworthy features of iPhones is that they tend to retain great value for many years to come hence they become a preferred choice for prying thieves. Further, they can be expensive for most budgets to begin with, so losing or misplacing your iPhone can cause a fair amount of heartache. Apple provides one of the best answers to how to track iPhones for free with its exclusive iCloud.

But before we move ahead and explain how to track your lost phone for free with iCloud, we should tell you that it is limited in its cell location tracking and other features in that it will only send a message to the Honor X7b device, lock or erase it, and not provide records of information traffic going in and out of the Honor X7b device. Here’s how to track lost iPhones for free.

Step 1. You will first need to ensure that the Find My iPhone feature is enabled on your device. This can be easily done by first launching the settings app on your iPhone, tapping on Apple ID at the top, and then iCloud and then Find My iPhone. Lastly, tab to enable it.

Step 2. Now it’s time to hit the cloud—iCloud we mean! First things first—head to <www.iCloud.com> from any browser and login with your credentials. From the dashboard, click on Find iPhone in the second row and enter your Apple ID and password if prompted. Since you may have several Apple devices connected with the same iCloud account, click on All Devices at the top, and select the Honor X7b device you wish to track from the dropdown.

Step 3. That’s really all there is to it! Once you select your device, you can do one of three things—play sound, activate lost mode or erase the Honor X7b device to prevent compromise of information.

## Part 1: How to Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak

The majority of spy apps in the market will only work on a jailbroken device or require you to jailbreak an iPhone before you can use them. While a jailbroken device does have its advantages, it can be quite problematic when you want to spy on an iPhone without alerting the owner to your activities. To begin with, you must have the iPhone to jailbreak it, a factor that makes it easier to get caught trying to spy on the Honor X7b device. Also, it is quite possible no matter how hard you try to hide the jailbreaking app that the owner will realize you have jailbroken their device.

For the best results you want to use a monitoring program that doesn’t require a jailbroken device to work. The best is [mSpy](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6), a monitoring program that will work on any iPhone and provide you with detailed information without the need to jailbreak the Honor X7b device. Here’s how to use mSpy to spy on an iPhone.

Step 1: Begin by activating iCloud Backup on the target device. Go to Settings and then select “iCloud” to do this. Using mSpy will require iCloud to be activated.

## Part 2: How to Spy using Spyware that Requires a Jailbreak

Being able to spy on an iPhone without a jailbreak is not something that happens often. This is because unlike mSpy, most monitoring software will require you jailbreak the Honor X7b device before you can install the software. One of those apps is TruthSpy. Like mSpy, this app will allow users to see all types of data on the target device without the owner of the Honor X7b device knowing they are being monitored. The only problem is, you need to have access to the Honor X7b device to jailbreak it. If this is what you prefer or are unable to get access to mSpy, TruthSpy will work just fine. Here’s how to use it.

Step 1: Begin by performing a jailbreak on the target device. There are several options to help you do that like Pangu software.

![Spy using Spyware with jailbreak-Pangu software](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074779011456.jpg)

Step 2: Once the Honor X7b device is successfully jailbroken, create an account with TruthSpy, purchase a subscription and you will receive instructions on how to install the software on the jailbroken device.

Step 3: You can then log in to TurthSpy with your log in information and access all types of data on the target iPhone from any bowser.

![Spy using Spyware with jailbreak-log in to TurthSpy](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079742762274.jpg)

Both mSpy and TruthSpy will provide you with all the information you need about the target device. The only difference is, you need to jailbreak the Honor X7b device if TruthSpy will be able to access it. Jailbreaking the

device will however make it easier for the Honor X7b device’s owner to find the spyware and remove it before you are able to complete your activities. It is therefore preferable to use a program like mSpy that requires no jailbreak.
