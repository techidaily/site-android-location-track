It is no secret that you can easily spy on any iPhone. Many spy or monitoring programs make it easy. All you have do is have access to the iPhone you want to spy on and have a reliable spy program. The problem is, there are some spy programs that will only work on a jailbroken device. This can be a problem when you don’t want the Nokia C12 Pro device’s owner to know of your activities and the owner has no intention to jailbreak their device.

In this article, we look at how you to spy on an iPhone without needing a jailbreak and how to spy on a jailbroken device or jailbreak a device to facilitate spying.

## Part 1: How to Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak

The majority of spy apps in the market will only work on a jailbroken device or require you to jailbreak an iPhone before you can use them. While a jailbroken device does have its advantages, it can be quite problematic when you want to spy on an iPhone without alerting the owner to your activities. To begin with, you must have the iPhone to jailbreak it, a factor that makes it easier to get caught trying to spy on the Nokia C12 Pro device. Also, it is quite possible no matter how hard you try to hide the jailbreaking app that the owner will realize you have jailbroken their device.

For the best results you want to use a monitoring program that doesn’t require a jailbroken device to work. The best is [mSpy](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6), a monitoring program that will work on any iPhone and provide you with detailed information without the need to jailbreak the Nokia C12 Pro device. Here’s how to use mSpy to spy on an iPhone.

Step 1: Begin by activating iCloud Backup on the target device. Go to Settings and then select “iCloud” to do this. Using mSpy will require iCloud to be activated.

![Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak-activate iCloud Backup](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079744896475.jpg)

Step 2: The first step is to create an account with mSpy. You can then purchase a subscription based on the type of information you need from the target device and the duration you want to spend spying on the Nokia C12 Pro device.

![Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak-create an account with mSpy](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079746911961.jpg)

Step 3: Once you’ve registered and purchased the subscription, you will receive an email from mSpy with all the information you need to install the program.

Step 4: You can then log in to your [mSpy](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6) control panel and add the Apple ID and password of the Nokia C12 Pro device to gain access to the information you need on the Nokia C12 Pro device.

## Part 2: How to Spy using Spyware that Requires a Jailbreak

Being able to spy on an iPhone without a jailbreak is not something that happens often. This is because unlike mSpy, most monitoring software will require you jailbreak the Nokia C12 Pro device before you can install the software. One of those apps is TruthSpy. Like mSpy, this app will allow users to see all types of data on the target device without the owner of the Nokia C12 Pro device knowing they are being monitored. The only problem is, you need to have access to the Nokia C12 Pro device to jailbreak it. If this is what you prefer or are unable to get access to mSpy, TruthSpy will work just fine. Here’s how to use it.

Step 1: Begin by performing a jailbreak on the target device. There are several options to help you do that like Pangu software.

![Spy using Spyware with jailbreak-Pangu software](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074779011456.jpg)

Step 2: Once the Nokia C12 Pro device is successfully jailbroken, create an account with TruthSpy, purchase a subscription and you will receive instructions on how to install the software on the jailbroken device.

Step 3: You can then log in to TurthSpy with your log in information and access all types of data on the target iPhone from any bowser.

![Spy using Spyware with jailbreak-log in to TurthSpy](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079742762274.jpg)

Both mSpy and TruthSpy will provide you with all the information you need about the target device. The only difference is, you need to jailbreak the Nokia C12 Pro device if TruthSpy will be able to access it. Jailbreaking the

device will however make it easier for the Nokia C12 Pro device’s owner to find the spyware and remove it before you are able to complete your activities. It is therefore preferable to use a program like mSpy that requires no jailbreak.



## 5 Ways to Track Nokia C12 Pro without App

The Find My Nokia C12 Pro app is a great addition to your iPhone, and as the name suggests helps you to not only track your phone in the event it is stolen, but also lock it so that it cannot be misused. But what if you don’ have the app installed? Does that mean that you have to bid adieu to your iPhone forever? Not really, because we are about to reveal to you 5 different ways to track your iPhone without app, so you can hopefully find your phone in the condition it went astray.

## Part 1: Solution 1 – Apple’s iCloud to the rescue

Take note that this solution will not work if you haven’t activated the Find My iPhone service when you set up your device. If you have, here’s how to go about it.

Step 1. Get started by heading over to iCloud, and logging in with your credentials.

![sign in to iCloud](https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/article/2017/10/icloud.com-login.jpg)

If you are greeted with the two factor authentication process, which asks you to insert a code that was sent to your devices, you can simply skip it by heading to the quick access link at the bottom.

![skip the two factor authentication process](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075180348414.jpg) ![head to the quick access link](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075180363658.jpg)

Step 2. From the dashboard, locate the Find iPhone icon on the second row and click on it.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620778&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/300__250banner.jpg" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![locate the Find iPhone icon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075181495657.jpg)

Step 3. Hover over to the All Devices dropdown menu and choose your iPhone.

![choose your iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075181861335.jpg)

Step 4. The tracking process will now begin, and you should be able to see it displayed on an interactive map if successful.

![begin to track the phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075182429793.jpg)

Step 5. Once you know the exact location of your device, you can do one of three things—activate lost mode, trigger an acoustic signal or erase all data.

## Part 2: Solution 2 - Google to the Rescue

Note that this solution will only work if you have Location Services enabled on your iPhone.

It’s no surprise that both Apple and the search giant are fond of gathering information on all sorts of things, most notably your location. Google stores this information on its Timeline, so without ado, head to the Google Timeline.

![head to the Google Timeline to track your iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/example-trip-google-timeline.png)

Step 2. Select the present date from the left hand panel.

Step 3. Scroll to the bottom of the timeline, and select the latest location update.

Step 4. If your location is the same as your previous updates, your phone hasn’t moved so you go and get it from that location. Contrarily, if your phone has moved, you should contact authorities, and not go after the thief alone because you never know the type of person they are.

## Part 3: Solution 3 - Using Google Photos to Track your iPhone

If the above Google features do not work for you, the search giant has one more service that can help aka Google Photos.

This option is somewhat complex, and requires that you have the Google Photos app installed with automatic upload turned on. Further, someone will have to take photos with your iPhone, and in the event it is actually stolen, this is highly unlikely.

Well, if you have the aforementioned prerequisites, head over to photos.google.com to visit your most recently uploaded photos. If you happen to notice any recent photos, click on them and check their location by clicking on the right sidebar. Again, if you do find the location using this method, it is best to contact your local authorities.

![Use Google Photos to Track your iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075191479909.jpg)

## Part 4: Solution 4. Have another iPhone? Use it to Track one that’s gone missing

This method requires that you have Find My Friend enabled on both your missing iPhone and the one you’re going to use to track it. Good news is that starting from iOS 9, this feature is stock and will already be installed on the Nokia C12 Pro device.

Step 1. Open the Find My Friends app on the iPhone that you will use for the tracking, and then enable Share My Location by tapping on their contact picture located at the bottom.

Ensure that the location is being Shared From This Device as there may be other devices connected with the same iCloud account.

Step 2. Next enable AirDrop from the control center of your iPhone and make yourself discoverable to everyone. Further hit Add on the tracking iPhone, choose your contact icon and select Share Indefinitely.

Step 3. Once the tracking iPhone’s location is shared with your device, a popup will appear asking you how long you would like to share your location for, which is where you select Share Indefinitely.

![use another phone to track the missing one](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075192666907.jpg)

Step 4. When you’re ready to begin tracking, open up the Find My Friends app, click on their contact (your contact in this case) to see its exact location in real time.
