## Solutions to Spy on Oppo A2 with and without jailbreak

It is no secret that you can easily spy on any iPhone. Many spy or monitoring programs make it easy. All you have do is have access to the iPhone you want to spy on and have a reliable spy program. The problem is, there are some spy programs that will only work on a jailbroken device. This can be a problem when you don’t want the Oppo A2 device’s owner to know of your activities and the owner has no intention to jailbreak their device.

In this article, we look at how you to spy on an iPhone without needing a jailbreak and how to spy on a jailbroken device or jailbreak a device to facilitate spying.


## Part 1: How to Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak

The majority of spy apps in the market will only work on a jailbroken device or require you to jailbreak an iPhone before you can use them. While a jailbroken device does have its advantages, it can be quite problematic when you want to spy on an iPhone without alerting the owner to your activities. To begin with, you must have the iPhone to jailbreak it, a factor that makes it easier to get caught trying to spy on the Oppo A2 device. Also, it is quite possible no matter how hard you try to hide the jailbreaking app that the owner will realize you have jailbroken their device.

For the best results you want to use a monitoring program that doesn’t require a jailbroken device to work. The best is [mSpy](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6), a monitoring program that will work on any iPhone and provide you with detailed information without the need to jailbreak the Oppo A2 device. Here’s how to use mSpy to spy on an iPhone.

Step 1: Begin by activating iCloud Backup on the target device. Go to Settings and then select “iCloud” to do this. Using mSpy will require iCloud to be activated.

Step 2: The first step is to create an account with mSpy. You can then purchase a subscription based on the type of information you need from the target device and the duration you want to spend spying on the Oppo A2 device.

Step 3: Once you’ve registered and purchased the subscription, you will receive an email from mSpy with all the information you need to install the program.

Step 4: You can then log in to your [mSpy](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6) control panel and add the Apple ID and password of the Oppo A2 device to gain access to the information you need on the Oppo A2 device.

## Part 2: How to Spy using Spyware that Requires a Jailbreak

Being able to spy on an iPhone without a jailbreak is not something that happens often. This is because unlike mSpy, most monitoring software will require you jailbreak the Oppo A2 device before you can install the software. One of those apps is TruthSpy. Like mSpy, this app will allow users to see all types of data on the target device without the owner of the Oppo A2 device knowing they are being monitored. The only problem is, you need to have access to the Oppo A2 device to jailbreak it. If this is what you prefer or are unable to get access to mSpy, TruthSpy will work just fine. Here’s how to use it.

Step 1: Begin by performing a jailbreak on the target device. There are several options to help you do that like Pangu software.

![Spy using Spyware with jailbreak-Pangu software](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074779011456.jpg)

Step 2: Once the Oppo A2 device is successfully jailbroken, create an account with TruthSpy, purchase a subscription and you will receive instructions on how to install the software on the jailbroken device.

Step 3: You can then log in to TurthSpy with your log in information and access all types of data on the target iPhone from any bowser.

![Spy using Spyware with jailbreak-log in to TurthSpy](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079742762274.jpg)

Both mSpy and TruthSpy will provide you with all the information you need about the target device. The only difference is, you need to jailbreak the Oppo A2 device if TruthSpy will be able to access it. Jailbreaking the

device will however make it easier for the Oppo A2 device’s owner to find the spyware and remove it before you are able to complete your activities. It is therefore preferable to use a program like mSpy that requires no jailbreak.

One way or another, anti-tracker software can be of great help to you. Check out the list of benefits below to understand it very well. For sure, the information provided below can guide you towards the best anti-tracking software options.

Therefore, install anti-tracker software on your device to prevent this kind of situation from happening.

But you need to jailbreak iPhone before installing FlexiSPY. For android devices, the root service is required for certain advanced features.

After installing the Flexispy on the Oppo A2 device you want to monitor, all the relevant information you want to monitor (GPS location, calls, texts) will upload to its server without knowing. The only thing you need to do is log in to your Flexispy account and click "Location" if you would like to track a cell phone.

Except for viewing the Oppo A2 device location data, you can also export GPS data to use on the mapping application you like.

How to Export GPS data:

Step 1: Click the "Export" button on the upper right corner.

## Part 3: How to secretly track someone

If you want to track a cell phone without them knowing secretly, then one interesting solution is the “Find my friends” app introduced by Apple though primarily not for spying purposes, but you can use it to spy on someone's iPhone secretly. This app comes with the facility to get a notification when the target person arrives or leaves a place. Here, if you have access to the target device and the “Find my friends” option then it will give you the solution on how to track a cell phone without them knowing.

Step1: Enable the option “Share my location” on the target phone. To enable share my location, open the app “Find my friends” > Go for the contact's photo > “Share my location”.

Step 2: Generally iCloud account has sharing options for all other devices. We have to ensure the sharing option is correctly viewed as the target device such as “This device”.

![track a cell phone without them knowing-share my location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/11/15100182891050.jpg)

Step 3: Now swipe from bottom to end, click on the “Airdrop” option from the settings. You will have two options such as “Everyone” and “Contacts only”.

Step 4: Move to the target device, in the “Find my friends” app click the option “add”. Now your contact picture will get displayed. Click on your profile photo > select the option “Share indefinitely” to track a cell phone without them knowing.

Step 5: The target device location will be shared with you. You will get a pop-up window “Accept” it. It will again ask if you want to share location so, click on “Don’t share”.

Step 6: Now go to your device, open the “Find my friends” app and click the icon of the target device. You will get a notification, where they are now when they leave from the place etc.

Note: If you want to hide the “Find my friends” app from the target device you can use the dock method which will be easy but the folder method is very tough.

## Part 4: Frequently Asked Questions

**1\. What is rooting? Does it have a warranty? Any rooting between Android and mSpy?**

Rooting is obviously known as the control between Android users and Android subsystems. It has a warranty period and rooting is applicable if you track WhatsApp, Facebook messages.

**2\. How one can detect the software to monitor on an Android device?**

mSpy is authorized and certified software and it has to run legally on both user and the target device. If the illegal process is found, you can assist customer support immediately.

**3\. If the phone was stolen, can I find My Oppo A2 using the number?**

mSpy activates if installed on the iPhone completely. The process of finding the phone using a number is not applicable in mSpy.

We must tell you using mSpy and FlexiSPY are both one of the best methods to track a cell phone. Both the applications have several metrics and would certainly assist in how to track a cell phone without them knowing. We know that tracking a cell phone without them knowing is illegal, but when it comes to our children's safety we have to do this at any cost.
