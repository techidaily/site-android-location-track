A while back, I was a little suspicious of my boyfriend’s behavior and wanted to track my boyfriend’s phone. As I did some research, I discovered that even though there are lots of spying tools out there, only a handful of them yields the desired results. I handpicked two apps to track my boyfriend and they certainly met my expectations. Therefore, I have provided a stepwise tutorial to use them right here.

## Part 1: How to Track My Boyfriend's Phone via mSpy?

1\. To use mSpy, you need to visit its website right [here](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH96F) and create your new account. Ideally, you need to follow similar steps as KidsGuard Pro’s installation to use mSpy.

2\. After creating your mSpy account and getting a paid subscription, you need to access the target device.

3\. Go to its Settings > Security and make sure that the option of downloading from Unknown Sources is turned on.

4\. Afterward, you can go to its website and download the app.

5\. Install and perform the setup of the app with your own account credentials.

6\. Once it is done, you can access its web-based dashboard remotely and gain all the needed information related to the target device.

Even though mSpy provides similar features to that of KidsGuard Pro, it only works on rooted (and jailbroken) devices. Additionally, it is comparatively more expensive than KidsGuard Pro and doesn’t truly have a full-invisible mode. Any smart user can detect the spying app, which might land you in trouble.

## Part 2: How to Track My Boyfriend's Phone via KidsGuard Pro?

As I wanted to learn how can I track my boyfriend’s phone, I stumbled upon an amazing tool – [KidsGuard Pro](https://www.clevguard.com/android-parental-control/). It provided a highly reliable and secure way to track a device’s location, its vital content, and so much more. Easy to download and use, KidsGuard Pro doesn’t require you to root your Nokia G310. After installing it on the target device, you can track it from the web dashboard control panel remotely.

Besides his real-time location, I was able to know his call logs, contacts, photos, social media activity, and so much more in one place. It allowed me to track my boyfriend in a trouble-free manner. You can also do the same by following these steps:

1\. Firstly, visit KidsGuard Pro’s official website right [here](https://panel.clevguard.com/sign-up?dev_tp=android) and create your new account. You need to sign-up with your email id and set up a strong password.

## Part 1. Everything You Should Know About Anti-Tracker Software

Just like any other thing in our digital world today, the internet has its good and bad sides. One minute, it can be a solution. The next, it can be a problem. That’s why you should keep everything in check whenever you surf the web. Make sure that you are browsing privately on your device and that no one is watching you somewhere. Is there a feasible way to protect yourself from this kind of cyber intrusion? Fortunately, there is. You can install anti-tracker software on your gadget and activate it whenever you use the internet. By far, it’s doing a great job in this regard.

![browsing the internet](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/anti-tracker-software-1.JPG)

Anti-tracker software generally immobilizes suspicious websites or plugins on your browsing device and prevents them from stealing your data online. It’s quite different from Virtual Private Networks because VPNs only encrypt browsing traffic and IP address. But regardless, both of them can indeed help you maintain anonymity when surfing online. Just choose the best anti-tracking software that matches your needs and works perfectly with your situation.

One way or another, anti-tracker software can be of great help to you. Check out the list of benefits below to understand it very well. For sure, the information provided below can guide you towards the best anti-tracking software options.

### It restricts anyone from accessing and stealing your personal information

![sensitive information](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/anti-tracker-software-2.JPG)

In today’s digital era, where identity theft is rampant everywhere, privacy matters the most. Keeping our personal data away from public access is the least we can do to protect ourselves. That’s why you should consider installing anti-tracker software on your devices. Somehow, it can give you an assurance that the sensitive information you share online is not out in the open. But, of course, choose the best anti-tracking software that is powerful enough to do that for you.

### It keeps your browsing history private

What happens if hackers get their hands on your browsing history? Well, there are lots of possibilities, and most of them can directly affect you. Information pertaining to the websites you visit on the internet is mostly used by third-party partners for research and advertising. Hackers sell it to them, along with other sensitive information embedded in your browser. Of course, nobody wants that. It’s clearly an invasion of privacy. Therefore, install anti-tracker software on your device to prevent this kind of situation from happening.

### It prevents advertisers from using your private information

It is nice if the ads that show up while we’re browsing include products we’re personally interested in. Hence, we cannot deny that giving legitimate advertisers access to our preferences is somehow beneficial to a certain degree. However, there are some third-party affiliates that are quite aggressive in tracking our browsing data. We should get rid of that the moment we spot them red-handed. It’s best to use anti-tracker software just to be sure.

### It protects us from internet scams
