## How to Track Vivo Y78+ by Phone Number

In most cases, tracking a lost iPhone has always been made possible thanks to the presence of tracking apps, and the use of the IMEI number. However, in the past few years, it has always been in the public domain and in the minds of many technocrats about the possibility of tracking an iPhone by only using its phone number (cellular number). Regardless of what has been said, tracking an iPhone using its number alone is a process that requires an in-depth understanding and application. In this article, we are going to take a look at the possibility of how to track an iPhone by phone number, as well as the use of the mSpy program to track a lost iPhone.

## Part 1: Is It Possible to Track An iPhone with Just the Number?

A lot of people have always asked me; is it possible to track my iPhone by phone number? Well; regardless of what people say out there, it is usually close to impossible to track your lost iPhone by primarily using only its phone number. In this case, the phone number in question is the number provided to you by your cellular provider. The moment you lose your iPhone, the chances of the thief changing your SIM card to another SIM card are high. This obviously makes it impossible to track your iPhone via a number that is no longer available. However, there's a leeway on how to track an iPhone by phone number though it depends on sheer chances and lack.

You can only track iPhone by phone number only if the culprit with the phone doesn’t change the SIM card. This is a sheer lack of procedure when you consider the fact that people nowadays steal phones and change the Sim cards as well as the IMEI numbers. If you want to track your iPhone in such cases, your only option would be to contact your cellular provider and ask them to perform a phone triangulation procedure or tell you if any calls were made using your number. Regardless of the type of iPhone tracking services, you might decide to use; the fact still remains that they can’t track your lost iPhone using the phone number. So don’t be duped by these companies or apps that claim to track your lost phone by using the phone number. What they can only do for you is to tell you the last position where the phone was detected, or if any calls were made and to whom. Basically, for you to trace your iPhone, you need its IMEI number, but not the phone number.
