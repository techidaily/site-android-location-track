Each Google product relies heavily on location information and utilizes it for various reasons. To understand it better, check out the list below.

However, take note that doing so might gravely affect the functionality of some Google products. If you don’t want it to happen, there’s an alternative solution you can try. Rather than denying Google access to your location, why not change it instead and register a fake one? Yes.
