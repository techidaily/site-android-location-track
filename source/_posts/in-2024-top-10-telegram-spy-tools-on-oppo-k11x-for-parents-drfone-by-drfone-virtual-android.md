## Part 4: Some Tips to Ensure Your Child’s Online Safety

- To be able to monitor phone activity with the help of spy tools listed above is great, but you can also make sure that your child is safe on the web by following these simple tips:
- Get to know and become a part of your kid's online activity. For instance, join Social media forums and let your kids know that you’re a part of their cyberworld activities too.
- Set up rules to visit/not to visit certain websites and at particular hours of the day only.
- Set-up browser tracking.
- Interact with your kids and make them understand the importance of keeping their personal details off the web.
- Set up restrictions on the search engine and block certain websites.
- Make sure you are the first person your child approaches whenever he/she is in trouble.

We hope you find this guide and instructions herein useful. We recommend you to use Famisafe for its features and discrete cell phone monitoring techniques. Share it with your near and dear one as well and promotes online child safety.
