## How to Check Distance and Radius on Google Maps For your Oppo A78

_“Is it possible to use Google Maps to calculate distance between multiple locations? I want to know the exact distance between different spots, but can’t seem to find any solution!”_

If you also wish to use the distance marker on Google Maps, then you might have a similar query like this. Apart from navigation, Google Maps can be used for different other applications as well. For instance, you can easily measure distance between two addresses on Google Maps. Besides that, you can also use the Google Maps distance radius feature to focus on a certain area. In this guide, I will let you know how to use Google location distance and radius features in detail.

## Part 1: Draw a Radius Circle on Google Maps

You might already know that Google Maps provides a map of the entire world for us to navigate. Though, there are times when users like to draw a radius on Google Maps for a particular location. Presently, the native feature of Google Maps does not have a distance radius tool. Therefore, to draw a radius on Google Maps, you would have to use an application that has its own interface. One of them is Map Developers that is based on Google Maps and has simply provided a solution to draw a radius on the map.

1. Firstly, just go to the official website of [Map Developers circle tool](https://www.mapdevelopers.com/draw-circle-tool.php) on any supported browser like Google Chrome. You can see that the website is based on Google Maps with its added layers to draw a radius on the map.

![google maps distance radius 2](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-2.jpg)

1. Now, just use the native feature of the map to zoom in to any location of your choice. You can also enter the name of the location that you are looking for in the search bar.
2. Besides that, you can also enter details about the radius of the circle, its color, and so on. After entering all the needed details, click on the “New Circle” button and it will be reflected on Google Maps interface.

![google maps distance radius 3](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-3.jpg)

If you want, you can later delete this circle or draw multiple circles in different colors to mark them in any location of your choice.

## Part 2: Determine the Distance with Radius on Google Maps

Apart from drawing a circle or radius on Google Maps, a lot of people would like to specify its distance as well. For instance, you might wish to specify a radius of specific miles or kilometers for a place on Google Maps. As stated above, the native feature of Google Maps is presently missing the distance radius feature. The good news is that there are tons of websites out there that have presented the same feature on the original layer of Google Maps.

- _Map Developers Radius_

Consider the example of the circle tool of Map Developers that we have discussed above. In this, you can just enter the name of a specific place on Google Maps. Now, you can specify the distance of radius in miles or kilometers. This will automatically draw the specific distance radius on Google Maps for the designated location.

In this, you would have to specify the exact coordinates of the place and the Google Maps distance radius value. After entering the relevant details, you can proceed and draw the radius distance on Google Maps.

## Part 3: Determine the Distance between two Addresses on Google Maps

This is one of the most resourceful features of Google Maps that a lot of people are not aware of. Using its native interface, you can find a straight line distance on Google Maps. That is, it won’t be the driving distance, but the exact distance between 2 places on Google Maps. If you want, you can add other spots to let Google Maps calculate distance between multiple locations as well. To learn how to measure distance between two addresses on Google Maps, follow these steps:

1. At first, just launch Google Maps on your system and go to the source location on it. You can click on any marked location or anywhere else on the map. Even if you click on any unmarked location, Google will load its coordinates for you.

![google maps distance radius 7](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-7.jpg)

1. Afterward, just click anywhere else on the map and it will automatically find a straight line distance in Google Maps between these two spots.

![google maps distance radius 8](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-8.jpg)

1. If you want to continue, then just click anywhere else on the map and that will be considered as the next spot. Therefore, you can just click as many times as you want to let Google Maps calculate distance between multiple locations.

![google maps distance radius 9](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-9.jpg)
