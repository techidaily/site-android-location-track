## Part 3: How to secretly track someone

If you want to track a cell phone without them knowing secretly, then one interesting solution is the “Find my friends” app introduced by Apple though primarily not for spying purposes, but you can use it to spy on someone's iPhone secretly. This app comes with the facility to get a notification when the target person arrives or leaves a place. Here, if you have access to the target device and the “Find my friends” option then it will give you the solution on how to track a cell phone without them knowing.

Step1: Enable the option “Share my location” on the target phone. To enable share my location, open the app “Find my friends” > Go for the contact's photo > “Share my location”.

Step 2: Generally iCloud account has sharing options for all other devices. We have to ensure the sharing option is correctly viewed as the target device such as “This device”.

Step 3: Now swipe from bottom to end, click on the “Airdrop” option from the settings. You will have two options such as “Everyone” and “Contacts only”.

Step 4: Move to the target device, in the “Find my friends” app click the option “add”. Now your contact picture will get displayed. Click on your profile photo > select the option “Share indefinitely” to track a cell phone without them knowing.

Note: If you want to hide the “Find my friends” app from the target device you can use the dock method which will be easy but the folder method is very tough.

## Part 4: Frequently Asked Questions

**1\. What is rooting? Does it have a warranty? Any rooting between Android and mSpy?**

Rooting is obviously known as the control between Android users and Android subsystems. It has a warranty period and rooting is applicable if you track WhatsApp, Facebook messages.

**2\. How one can detect the software to monitor on an Android device?**

mSpy is authorized and certified software and it has to run legally on both user and the target device. If the illegal process is found, you can assist customer support immediately.

**3\. If the phone was stolen, can I find My Nokia C32 using the number?**

mSpy activates if installed on the iPhone completely. The process of finding the phone using a number is not applicable in mSpy.
