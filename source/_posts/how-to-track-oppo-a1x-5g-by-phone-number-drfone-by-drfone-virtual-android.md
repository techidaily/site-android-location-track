## How to Track Oppo A1x 5G by Phone Number

In most cases, tracking a lost iPhone has always been made possible thanks to the presence of tracking apps, and the use of the IMEI number. However, in the past few years, it has always been in the public domain and in the minds of many technocrats about the possibility of tracking an iPhone by only using its phone number (cellular number). Regardless of what has been said, tracking an iPhone using its number alone is a process that requires an in-depth understanding and application. In this article, we are going to take a look at the possibility of how to track an iPhone by phone number, as well as the use of the mSpy program to track a lost iPhone.

## Part 1: Is It Possible to Track An iPhone with Just the Number?

A lot of people have always asked me; is it possible to track my iPhone by phone number? Well; regardless of what people say out there, it is usually close to impossible to track your lost iPhone by primarily using only its phone number. In this case, the phone number in question is the number provided to you by your cellular provider. The moment you lose your iPhone, the chances of the thief changing your SIM card to another SIM card are high. This obviously makes it impossible to track your iPhone via a number that is no longer available. However, there's a leeway on how to track an iPhone by phone number though it depends on sheer chances and lack.

You can only track iPhone by phone number only if the culprit with the phone doesn’t change the SIM card. This is a sheer lack of procedure when you consider the fact that people nowadays steal phones and change the Sim cards as well as the IMEI numbers. If you want to track your iPhone in such cases, your only option would be to contact your cellular provider and ask them to perform a phone triangulation procedure or tell you if any calls were made using your number. Regardless of the type of iPhone tracking services, you might decide to use; the fact still remains that they can’t track your lost iPhone using the phone number. So don’t be duped by these companies or apps that claim to track your lost phone by using the phone number. What they can only do for you is to tell you the last position where the phone was detected, or if any calls were made and to whom. Basically, for you to trace your iPhone, you need its IMEI number, but not the phone number.

## How to Turn Off Google Location to Stop Tracking You on Oppo A1x 5G

The location services that Google provides to Android smartphones are indeed useful in many ways. For instance, you can use Google Maps to check a particular place you want to visit and obtain reliable directions to help you get there. Another thing, Google can also give you the exact location of your Oppo A1x 5G in case you lost it somewhere. Indeed, Google’s GPS tracking feature comes in very handy whenever you need such assistance.

It’s true to say that Google's location monitoring services offer tons of benefits to us. But at some point, we cannot deny that activating this feature somehow entails a certain privacy and security risk. That’s why many users opt to **turn off Google location tracking** and keep their whereabouts private. Don’t worry. It’s totally fine. You can implement such measures, too, if you’re uncomfortable sharing your location details with Google. All it takes to turn off Google location tracking is just a few taps on your mobile device.

In this article, we will discuss how Google employs location access on your mobile device. We will also provide some quick tutorials on how to turn off Google location tracking in easy steps. Continue reading below to learn more.

## Part 3. Keep Your Whereabouts Private With [<u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/)

Google surely understands that some users are uncomfortable sharing their whereabouts with the platform. That’s why you’re given the option to turn off Google location tracking on your Oppo A1x 5G smartphone. However, take note that doing so might gravely affect the functionality of some Google products. If you don’t want it to happen, there’s an alternative solution you can try. Rather than denying Google access to your location, why not change it instead and register a fake one? Yes. That can absolutely help you conceal your whereabouts without compromising the quality of Google services. Don’t worry. It’s a piece of cake. Wondershare Dr.Fone can help you a lot in this regard. It has a potent Virtual Location feature capable of modifying your whereabouts and simulating GPS movements. Do you want to try it now? Here’s a short guide for you.



**Step 1:** Download Wondershare Dr.Fone from its [<u>official website.</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) Subsequently, install it on your computer.

**Step 2:** Launch the newly installed software on your desktop. Once it fully loads up, connect your Oppo A1x 5G smartphone using a data cable. Follow the on-screen instructions to make sure that the connection between the two devices is stable enough to handle the succeeding procedures.

**Step 3:** Go to the left-side panel and then click **Toolbox.** On the main dashboard, click **Virtual Location.** Is it your first time accessing this feature? If so, Wondershare Dr.Fone will then download additional resources from the server. Don’t worry. The downloading process will only take a few minutes.

**Step 4:** After completing the downloading process, Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location will open in a separate window. From there, navigate to the top-right menu bar and then click **Teleport Mode.**

**Step 7:** The location registered on your Oppo A1x 5G mobile device will now be replaced with your modified whereabouts. Verify the changes applied on your smartphone by checking Google Maps and searching for your current location. One way or another, it must show the altered result.

**NOTE:** If you want to restore your original location settings, simply disconnect your smartphone from the computer and restart it.

## Conclusion

No need to borrow an Atlas from the library just to find a location you want to visit. However, in exchange for this convenience, you have to share location access with Google. Some users are not confident to access this privilege at the expense of their privacy. Don’t worry. That’s totally fine. If you’re one of them, this article can help you turn off Google location tracking on your Oppo A1x 5G. Is there a more conservative approach to address this issue? Luckily, there is. Download [<u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) on your computer and take advantage of its Virtual Location feature. It can help modify your whereabouts and simulate GPS movements without going outdoors.
