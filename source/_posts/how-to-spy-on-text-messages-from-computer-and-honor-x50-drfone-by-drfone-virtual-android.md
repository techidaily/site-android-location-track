## Two Ways to Track My Boyfriend's Honor X50 without Him Knowing

How can I track my boyfriend’s phone? If you also have the same question, then this would be the last post you’ll read. A while back, I was a little suspicious of my boyfriend’s behavior and wanted to track my boyfriend’s phone. As I did some research, I discovered that even though there are lots of spying tools out there, only a handful of them yields the desired results. I handpicked two apps to track my boyfriend and they certainly met my expectations. Therefore, I have provided a stepwise tutorial to use them right here.

## Part 1: How to Track My Boyfriend's Phone via mSpy?

When I wanted to learn how can I track my boyfriend’s phone, I tried various third-party solutions. I tried [mSpy](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH96F) .

![track my boyfriend’s phone-via mSpy](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082599886089.jpg)

1\. To use mSpy, you need to visit its website right [here](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH96F) and create your new account. Ideally, you need to follow similar steps as KidsGuard Pro’s installation to use mSpy.

2\. After creating your mSpy account and getting a paid subscription, you need to access the target device.

3\. Go to its Settings > Security and make sure that the option of downloading from Unknown Sources is turned on.

![track my boyfriend’s phone via mSpy-download from Unknown Sources](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082600151360.jpg)

4\. Afterward, you can go to its website and download the app.

5\. Install and perform the setup of the app with your own account credentials.

6\. Once it is done, you can access its web-based dashboard remotely and gain all the needed information related to the target device.

![track my boyfriend’s phone via mSpy-access its web-based dashboard](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082600392625.jpg)

Even though mSpy provides similar features to that of KidsGuard Pro, it only works on rooted (and jailbroken) devices. Additionally, it is comparatively more expensive than KidsGuard Pro and doesn’t truly have a full-invisible mode. Any smart user can detect the spying app, which might land you in trouble.

## Part 2: How to Track My Boyfriend's Phone via KidsGuard Pro?

As I wanted to learn how can I track my boyfriend’s phone, I stumbled upon an amazing tool – [KidsGuard Pro](https://www.clevguard.com/android-parental-control/). It provided a highly reliable and secure way to track a device’s location, its vital content, and so much more. Easy to download and use, KidsGuard Pro doesn’t require you to root your Honor X50. After installing it on the target device, you can track it from the web dashboard control panel remotely.

Since it runs in stealth mode, it allowed me to track my boyfriend’s phone without getting detected. Besides his real-time location, I was able to know his call logs, contacts, photos, social media activity, and so much more in one place. It allowed me to track my boyfriend in a trouble-free manner. You can also do the same by following these steps:

1\. Firstly, visit KidsGuard Pro’s official website right [here](https://panel.clevguard.com/sign-up?dev_tp=android) and create your new account. You need to sign-up with your email id and set up a strong password.

![track my boyfriend’s phone-sign up KidsGuard Pro ](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/create-an-account-for-clevguard.jpg)

2\. Secondly, after buying the product, you need to download the KidsGuard Pro app on your target device. Please go to the My Products and Orders Management page and click "Setup Guide" to follow the instructions carefully and complete all settings on the target device.

3\. Great! Now all you need to do is log in to your KidsGuard Pro account on their website using your account credentials. On the home page, you can access all the major information related to the Honor X50 device like its location, frequent callers, and more.

![track my boyfriend’s phone-log-in to KidsGuard Pro’s dashboard](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/android-control-panel.jpg)

4\. Furthermore, you can simply visit the desired section from the left panel to get in-depth access. For instance, by visiting the “Locations” section, you can view the real-time location of the Honor X50 device, the previously visited places, and more.

After following these instructions, I was also able to track my boyfriend without much trouble. KidsGuard Pro also provides a seamless way to track the social media activity on the target device, record calls, listen to its surroundings, etc. Furthermore, you can enable its Keylogging feature as well to get a comprehensive record of everything typed on the Honor X50 device.

This will prevent you from any unforeseen situation. Now when you know better, you can easily use KidsGuard Pro to track any Android or iOS device.
