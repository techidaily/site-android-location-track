![phone number locator-Caller ID and Number Locator](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/11/15099056309953.jpg)

**Features**

- This software works through a database of added information on more than 12,982 cities.
- The call identifier feature will let you in on the real caller before you can answer the phone.
- There is also the option of a call blocker in case your caller gets too annoying to handle! (Or too offensive.)

**Pros**

- It doesn't necessarily require an Internet connection.
- This app has spread its wings over 200 countries globally.
- The location of the caller and the caller ID is viewable.
- With the caller blocker feature, it's possible to block any annoying caller.
- The availability of a Google map positioning technology makes it easier to pinpoint the exact location.

**Cons**

- It doesn't work on Android versions below 4.0.

## 5\. Truecaller

This is noted as the best leading app over the globe. There must be some better features compared to the previous ones if that's the case, yes?

It is cited to be the best caller ID app and it even blocks danger-rangers, their calls, and SMS. You can identify the person or the company that calls you before picking up. Be it landlines, mobile, or pre-paid even if you don't have the contact stored in your device!

You don't have to worry about telemarketers calling you or robocalls anymore. Spammers can't make an appearance ever again and consider yourself safe for life.

![phone number locator-Truecaller](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/11/15099056551018.jpg)

**Features**

- This renowned app has got a block feature.
- This is the best- you can view the caller's profile that includes their name and photo!
- There is also a contact directory that will help you find an unknown number.
- You need not worry if your phonebook contacts get uploaded- this is an impossibility where Truecaller is concerned.
- If you end up calling the wrong number, they might search you up (!) and you would definitely know it too. Another perk!
- This app undoubtedly offers the best tracking services.

**Pros**

- Your phonebook contacts won't be uploaded online.
- It's easy to know if you were searched online (or, your number for that matter).
- It's possible to make calls directly from the app.
- This app has got over 200 million users as it offers the most trusted and efficient services to make their customers happy.

**Cons**

- It requests an Internet connection.
- You must supply your phone number to the makers for this app to work.

## 6\. Number Locator

This iPhone-based software works on simple terms- all you must do is copy-paste the number in the search bar and hit search.

It works expeditiously as they have got a working database system. With the ready-made information just beneath your fingertips, it makes it even better for you as you can carry on with your expeditions with unknown numbers both offline and online!

![phone number locator-Number Locator](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/11/15099056808912.jpg)

**Features**

- It works in both offline and online modes.
- It has got a directory of area codes.
- There is an auto-updating tab that will keep your app up-to-date.
- This app works on all iOS devices.
- You will get the search results within a snap of your fingers (It's super-fast!)
- It works to serve you in the absence of an internet connection as well.

**Pros**

- It has an interactive user interface.
- It doesn't require an active Internet connection.
- It works on iPad, iPhone, and iPod.
- Its lovely animated graphics attract the majority of the user-ship.
- It delivers data quickly.

**Cons**

- The services might be free but you need to pay $0.99 for the extra graphics.
- The utilization of the app may be affected if it's continuously run.

## 7\. Mobile Number Tracker Pro

This app has got unrivaled tracking features that will let you know who the unwelcome caller is by the end of the search.

Mobile Number Tracker Pro gives you an insight into an unknown caller's City, State, and telecom operator company name. You don't require a working Internet connection, only the latest version of this app to get you on track!

It's really quick in showing the results, details, and that's what makes this app a popular one.

![phone number locator-Mobile Number Tracker Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/11/15099057098598.jpg)

**Features**

- Its database spans more than 200 countries all over the globe.
- Its notification center will supply you with an alert once the searched number's location is found.
- Its interactive user interface attracts the majority of the users.
- If you want, you can make calls or send messages from the app itself.

**Pros**

- It's easy to track any number globally using this app.
- It has an interactive user interface.

**Cons**

- The map locator is not always very high-octane as it may fail to show you the actual location.
- It needs an active internet connection to work.

Where do you think these creators of number locators gather all this personal information from? It's absolutely frightening to think of how they would get hold of our information, isn't it? But, that's a topic for another day. It's certainly helpful if one doesn't misuse this information for their own personal gain now, right?
