## Part 1: How to know whether your text message has been intercepted?

Intercepting a target phone could give us the controls and allow us to spy on various activities happening on the target phone even to the extent of giving us information about what’s happening in the surrounding. It does this by listening to the conversation by turning on the microphone even when the target phone is not in use. So, while the spying application keeps running in the background silently, text messages can be easily intercepted. So, it is imperative to know and read the signs to actually get to know if your text messages are being intercepted. There are some signs which could give you an idea if your text message has been intercepted.

**Odd Phone Behavior** – If your phone is behaving erratic and lights up suddenly even when not in use, it is possible that the cell phone is being intercepted. Some other signs could be random beeping noise, phone shutting down by itself, etc. While this might happen normally at times, if it is happening on a regular basis, there is a chance that the phone text message or for that matter phone data is being intercepted.

**Battery Rundown** – Some spy software running in the background can consume a lot of battery charge. If there is a dramatic change in the battery consumption and the phone now needs charging more often, it might mean that text messages or the phone is being intercepted.

**Phone Shuts down** – If your phone regularly shuts down by itself, even if the battery is fully charged, there could be one spy application running on the phone.

**Increased data usage** – If you see a dramatic increase in the consumption of data, it could be due to the spy application running silently in the background. The spy applications constantly send the recorded text message logs and data from the target phone which increases data consumption.

So, these are some signs which could suggest that your text message has been intercepted.

Intercepting text messages is now very easy using a robust application which can intercept any device in some simple steps. Moreover, the application can be used with both iOS and Android devices.

## Part 3: How to Track a Cell Phone Location via mSpy?

We’ve just given you two solutions to how to track a cell phone location without installing software, but they are limited in the features they offer, meaning you can just check cell phone location. But there may be times when you may feel the need to get a comprehensive look or rather a mirror image of what your cell phone is being used for. And for that, there is [mSpy](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6), an app that allows you to not only track Your Poco X6 location but rings in with several other handy features.

Billed as the ultimate software for parental control, [mSpy](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6) is compatible with Android, iOS, Windows PC and MAC OS and is easily accessible from any web browser. It is easy to install and if you experience any hiccups, you can always refer to the free online help. Further, it is available in several countries and backed by stellar multi-language customer support. mSpy offers three unique plans to choose from, each with its rich set of features that include the ability to manage calls, track text messages, read emails, track GPS location, monitor browsing history and internet use, control apps and programs and read instant messages from the app such as WhatsApp for a grand total of 24 features.

Step 1. After selecting the right plan for your needs, you will have to register the software.

Step 3. You can select from several options in the left hand, two of the most noteworthy being geo-fencing and WhatsApp. Geo-fencing is a great feature to monitor both your kids and employees and basically, allows you to set up parameters and alert you when they are breached.

WhatsApp is a highly secure chat application, but mSpy backed by the latest technology also allows you to monitor its messages both incoming and outgoing. Simply click on the WhatsApp tab and you will be presented with a list of WhatsApp messages that you can further sort through by date.

There are several instances such as in the excitement of getting a new phone that we may overlook the need to install software to track a cell phone. But both Google and Apple are generous enough to offer a solution to track your cell phone location without having to install any third-party software. But if you’re like to do a lot more than just track your cell phone’s location, mSpy with its expensive list of features sets the gold standard in this space.
