## Solutions to Spy on Vivo Y55s 5G (2023) with and without jailbreak

It is no secret that you can easily spy on any iPhone. Many spy or monitoring programs make it easy. All you have do is have access to the iPhone you want to spy on and have a reliable spy program. The problem is, there are some spy programs that will only work on a jailbroken device. This can be a problem when you don’t want the Vivo Y55s 5G (2023) device’s owner to know of your activities and the owner has no intention to jailbreak their device.

In this article, we look at how you to spy on an iPhone without needing a jailbreak and how to spy on a jailbroken device or jailbreak a device to facilitate spying.


## Part 1: How to Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak

The majority of spy apps in the market will only work on a jailbroken device or require you to jailbreak an iPhone before you can use them. While a jailbroken device does have its advantages, it can be quite problematic when you want to spy on an iPhone without alerting the owner to your activities. To begin with, you must have the iPhone to jailbreak it, a factor that makes it easier to get caught trying to spy on the Vivo Y55s 5G (2023) device. Also, it is quite possible no matter how hard you try to hide the jailbreaking app that the owner will realize you have jailbroken their device.

For the best results you want to use a monitoring program that doesn’t require a jailbroken device to work. The best is [mSpy](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6), a monitoring program that will work on any iPhone and provide you with detailed information without the need to jailbreak the Vivo Y55s 5G (2023) device. Here’s how to use mSpy to spy on an iPhone.

Step 1: Begin by activating iCloud Backup on the target device. Go to Settings and then select “iCloud” to do this. Using mSpy will require iCloud to be activated.

![Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak-activate iCloud Backup](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079744896475.jpg)

Step 2: The first step is to create an account with mSpy. You can then purchase a subscription based on the type of information you need from the target device and the duration you want to spend spying on the Vivo Y55s 5G (2023) device.

![Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak-create an account with mSpy](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079746911961.jpg)

Step 3: Once you’ve registered and purchased the subscription, you will receive an email from mSpy with all the information you need to install the program.

Step 4: You can then log in to your [mSpy](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6) control panel and add the Apple ID and password of the Vivo Y55s 5G (2023) device to gain access to the information you need on the Vivo Y55s 5G (2023) device.

## Part 2: How to Spy using Spyware that Requires a Jailbreak

Being able to spy on an iPhone without a jailbreak is not something that happens often. This is because unlike mSpy, most monitoring software will require you jailbreak the Vivo Y55s 5G (2023) device before you can install the software. One of those apps is TruthSpy. Like mSpy, this app will allow users to see all types of data on the target device without the owner of the Vivo Y55s 5G (2023) device knowing they are being monitored. The only problem is, you need to have access to the Vivo Y55s 5G (2023) device to jailbreak it. If this is what you prefer or are unable to get access to mSpy, TruthSpy will work just fine. Here’s how to use it.

Step 1: Begin by performing a jailbreak on the target device. There are several options to help you do that like Pangu software.

![Spy using Spyware with jailbreak-Pangu software](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074779011456.jpg)

Step 2: Once the Vivo Y55s 5G (2023) device is successfully jailbroken, create an account with TruthSpy, purchase a subscription and you will receive instructions on how to install the software on the jailbroken device.

Step 3: You can then log in to TurthSpy with your log in information and access all types of data on the target iPhone from any bowser.

Both mSpy and TruthSpy will provide you with all the information you need about the target device. The only difference is, you need to jailbreak the Vivo Y55s 5G (2023) device if TruthSpy will be able to access it. Jailbreaking the

device will however make it easier for the Vivo Y55s 5G (2023) device’s owner to find the spyware and remove it before you are able to complete your activities. It is therefore preferable to use a program like mSpy that requires no jailbreak.

## How to Check Distance and Radius on Google Maps For your Vivo Y55s 5G (2023)

_“Is it possible to use Google Maps to calculate distance between multiple locations? I want to know the exact distance between different spots, but can’t seem to find any solution!”_

If you also wish to use the distance marker on Google Maps, then you might have a similar query like this. Apart from navigation, Google Maps can be used for different other applications as well. For instance, you can easily measure distance between two addresses on Google Maps. Besides that, you can also use the Google Maps distance radius feature to focus on a certain area. In this guide, I will let you know how to use Google location distance and radius features in detail.

![google maps distance radius 1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-1.jpg)


## Part 1: Draw a Radius Circle on Google Maps

You might already know that Google Maps provides a map of the entire world for us to navigate. Though, there are times when users like to draw a radius on Google Maps for a particular location. Presently, the native feature of Google Maps does not have a distance radius tool. Therefore, to draw a radius on Google Maps, you would have to use an application that has its own interface. One of them is Map Developers that is based on Google Maps and has simply provided a solution to draw a radius on the map.

1. Firstly, just go to the official website of [Map Developers circle tool](https://www.mapdevelopers.com/draw-circle-tool.php) on any supported browser like Google Chrome. You can see that the website is based on Google Maps with its added layers to draw a radius on the map.

![google maps distance radius 2](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-2.jpg)

1. Now, just use the native feature of the map to zoom in to any location of your choice. You can also enter the name of the location that you are looking for in the search bar.
2. Besides that, you can also enter details about the radius of the circle, its color, and so on. After entering all the needed details, click on the “New Circle” button and it will be reflected on Google Maps interface.

![google maps distance radius 3](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-3.jpg)

If you want, you can later delete this circle or draw multiple circles in different colors to mark them in any location of your choice.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Part 2: Determine the Distance with Radius on Google Maps

Apart from drawing a circle or radius on Google Maps, a lot of people would like to specify its distance as well. For instance, you might wish to specify a radius of specific miles or kilometers for a place on Google Maps. As stated above, the native feature of Google Maps is presently missing the distance radius feature. The good news is that there are tons of websites out there that have presented the same feature on the original layer of Google Maps.

- _Map Developers Radius_

Consider the example of the circle tool of Map Developers that we have discussed above. In this, you can just enter the name of a specific place on Google Maps. Now, you can specify the distance of radius in miles or kilometers. This will automatically draw the specific distance radius on Google Maps for the designated location.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![google maps distance radius 4](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-4.jpg)

- _KML Circle Generator_

If you know the exact longitude and latitude of the place, then you can also take the assistance of KML Circle Generator. In this, you would have to specify the exact coordinates of the place and the Google Maps distance radius value. After entering the relevant details, you can proceed and draw the radius distance on Google Maps.

## Part 3: Determine the Distance between two Addresses on Google Maps

This is one of the most resourceful features of Google Maps that a lot of people are not aware of. Using its native interface, you can find a straight line distance on Google Maps. That is, it won’t be the driving distance, but the exact distance between 2 places on Google Maps. If you want, you can add other spots to let Google Maps calculate distance between multiple locations as well. To learn how to measure distance between two addresses on Google Maps, follow these steps:

1. At first, just launch Google Maps on your system and go to the source location on it. You can click on any marked location or anywhere else on the map. Even if you click on any unmarked location, Google will load its coordinates for you.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![google maps distance radius 6](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-6.jpg)

1. Now, once the source location is identified, you need to right-click it to get its context menu. From the available options on the context menu, click on “Measure Distance”.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![google maps distance radius 7](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-7.jpg)

1. Afterward, just click anywhere else on the map and it will automatically find a straight line distance in Google Maps between these two spots.

![google maps distance radius 8](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-8.jpg)

1. If you want to continue, then just click anywhere else on the map and that will be considered as the next spot. Therefore, you can just click as many times as you want to let Google Maps calculate distance between multiple locations.

![google maps distance radius 9](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-9.jpg)

This technique will let you measure distance between any addresses on Google Maps. It doesn’t matter if it is your present location or not. If you want to measure distance in some other location, then just enter its name in the search bar to load it. In this way, you can measure distance anywhere in the world by sitting in your home.

This brings us to the end of this extensive guide on using Google Maps distance and radius features. As you can see, I have provided a smart and user-friendly solution to draw radius distance on Google Maps. Besides that, you can also follow the above guide to measure distance between two addresses on Google Maps. In the same way, you can also let Google Maps calculate distance between multiple locations as well.
