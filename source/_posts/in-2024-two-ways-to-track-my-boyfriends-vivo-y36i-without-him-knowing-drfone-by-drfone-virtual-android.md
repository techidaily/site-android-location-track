## Part 1: How to Track My Boyfriend's Phone via mSpy?

When I wanted to learn how can I track my boyfriend’s phone, I tried various third-party solutions. I tried [mSpy](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH96F) .

![track my boyfriend’s phone-via mSpy](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082599886089.jpg)

1\. To use mSpy, you need to visit its website right [here](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH96F) and create your new account. Ideally, you need to follow similar steps as KidsGuard Pro’s installation to use mSpy.

2\. After creating your mSpy account and getting a paid subscription, you need to access the target device.

3\. Go to its Settings > Security and make sure that the option of downloading from Unknown Sources is turned on.

4\. Afterward, you can go to its website and download the app.

5\. Install and perform the setup of the app with your own account credentials.

6\. Once it is done, you can access its web-based dashboard remotely and gain all the needed information related to the target device.

![track my boyfriend’s phone via mSpy-access its web-based dashboard](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082600392625.jpg)

Even though mSpy provides similar features to that of KidsGuard Pro, it only works on rooted (and jailbroken) devices. Additionally, it is comparatively more expensive than KidsGuard Pro and doesn’t truly have a full-invisible mode. Any smart user can detect the spying app, which might land you in trouble.

## Part 2: How to Track My Boyfriend's Phone via KidsGuard Pro?

As I wanted to learn how can I track my boyfriend’s phone, I stumbled upon an amazing tool – [KidsGuard Pro](https://www.clevguard.com/android-parental-control/). It provided a highly reliable and secure way to track a device’s location, its vital content, and so much more. Easy to download and use, KidsGuard Pro doesn’t require you to root your Vivo Y36i. After installing it on the target device, you can track it from the web dashboard control panel remotely.

Since it runs in stealth mode, it allowed me to track my boyfriend’s phone without getting detected. Besides his real-time location, I was able to know his call logs, contacts, photos, social media activity, and so much more in one place. It allowed me to track my boyfriend in a trouble-free manner. You can also do the same by following these steps:

1\. Firstly, visit KidsGuard Pro’s official website right [here](https://panel.clevguard.com/sign-up?dev_tp=android) and create your new account. You need to sign-up with your email id and set up a strong password.

![track my boyfriend’s phone-sign up KidsGuard Pro ](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/create-an-account-for-clevguard.jpg)

## Option 4: Google Maps (It will be available in the next version)

Introduction: This application is implementing new features for drivers to find parking more easily. It tries to help those forgetful drivers who park but then do not know where they parked the vehicle. For them, Maps is responsible for collecting information on the time in which they have been stopped after moving by car, if we have the mobile connected to the car by Bluetooth, the application understands that we have been using a vehicle, and shows the parking with a round blue icon with a capital P inside. If this does not appear, it can also be saved in another way. Once parked you can open the map of the application and click on the blue point of location. At that time it gives us the option to Save your parking leaving the blue icon mentioned above.

The second functionality of Google Maps in developing is the option to know where we can find available parking. In addition to the information collected by the application of our travels, it is able to show the most traveled places and with or greater parking so it can inform you where you are most likely to find parking. How does it work? A small red icon with a blank P appears next to the destination that we selected in our search. Next to the letter appears a text that indicates information about the parking in that zone.

Unfortunately, these options are not yet implemented on all Android and iOS smartphones. If our mobile phone does not yet have any of these features wait for the latest update as it is expected to be available on these operating systems very soon as a car locator device.

**Features:**

GPS locator for car

Shows available parking.

## How to Track a Lost Vivo Y36i for Free?

A cell phone is a rather small device when compared to other things you may haul around on a daily basis such as a purse or wallet and even a bunch of keys. Hence, forgetting it somewhere or having it stolen is highly likely.
