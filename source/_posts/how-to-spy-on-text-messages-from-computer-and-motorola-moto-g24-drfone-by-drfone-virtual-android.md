Why monitor cell phone activity? This question crosses the mind of every parent at some point or the other. Parental control and phone spy tools make it easy for parents to monitor phone activities and ensure children’s safety at all times. Parents are aware of where their kid is, who he/she is with, their actions, and their social media interactions, which are important inputs for parents to analyze their kid’s behavior and whether or not their child is in a safe company.

Moving on, we all know that the internet/web is a blessing for this generation, but if misused, it can have catastrophic results. Children often fall prey to websites, online games, etc. that deviate their attention from studies and drive them to indulge in hazardous activities.

To protect your child’s future and know for sure that he/she is using their cell phone and the internet for productive uses only, it is important for parents to monitor phone activity regularly. To do so, many phone spy software and parental control apps are available. These tools work as browser trackers, call logs/messages trackers, real-time location trackers, Social media hacks, etc.

Given below are two great software to monitor cell phone activity easily. Give them a good read and use them to monitor phone activity on Android/iPhone.

## How to Detect and Remove Spyware on Motorola Moto G24?

As scary as it sounds, it is actually quite possible that someone is spying on your iPhone. These hackers and sometimes amateurs make use of sophisticated spy software to infiltrate your device and have access to your information. If you have reason to suspect that someone might have access to your iPhone, it is important to take the steps to figure out just how they gained access to the Motorola Moto G24 device and how to eliminate the threat. This article will help you with both.

## Part 1: Can Someone Spy on my iPhone?

The biggest question most iPhone users have is; can someone spy on my iPhone? The truth is, it is actually quite easy to spy on an iPhone remotely thanks to the availability of many kinds of spy or monitoring programs. A hacker can also gain access to your device’s information through phishing websites. If you have ever seen those ads while browsing that tell you’ve won something spectacular even though you didn’t enter a competition, clicking on the ad often leads to a phishing website where your information could be severely compromised.

It is important to note that this can happen to anyone partly due to the sophisticated ways that hackers can infiltrate a device. Thanks to spying software, the person spying on your iPhone doesn’t even need to be a sophisticated hacker. They can be your spouse or employer.

## Part 2: How to Detect Spyware on iPhone?

The most logical step to take when you suspect that someone is spying on your iPhone is to take steps to detect the spyware. Once you are certain there is spyware on the Motorola Moto G24 device, you are in a position to do something about it. The problem is, detecting spyware can be next to impossible because such software is designed to remain undetectable. But there are several signs that your iPhone is compromised. The following are just some of the signs to look out for.

#### **1\. Data Usage Spikes**

Most spyware will use up your data to work. That’s because they have to receive the information every time you send a message or make a call. Therefore, one of the ways to check for spy activity on your device is to monitor data usage. If it’s above what you would normally use, you may have spyware.

![Detect Spyware on iPhone-via Data Usage Spikes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074739266945.jpg)

#### **2\. The Cydia App**

The presence of the Cydia app on your device when you didn’t perform a jailbreak is another indicator of spyware. Do a Spotlight search for “Cydia” to see if you find it. But the Cydia app can be very difficult to detect because sometimes it can be hidden. To eliminate the possibility, enter “4433\*29342” into the spotlight search.

![Detect Spyware on iPhone-via the Cydia App](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074740091683.jpg)

#### **3\. A warm iPhone**

Do you notice that your iPhone is warm even when you are not using it? If this happens, it is very likely that there is an app running in the background. Most spyware apps are designed to run in the background so this is a big indicator of spy activity.

![Detect Spyware on iPhone-notice that your iPhone is warm](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079738897604.jpg)

#### **4\. Background Noises**

When you hear background noises during a call that have nothing to do with location, there may be active spyware on your device. This particularly happens when the spyware is there to monitor your phone calls.

## Part 3: How to Remove Spyware from iPhone?

Having a Spyware app on your device can be dangerous on many levels. Not only is the person spying on you violating your privacy, but they are also capable of getting vital information from your device like your address or bank information. Therefore, it is imperative that you take steps to remove the spyware o your device as soon as possible. The following are just some of the things you can do.

#### **1\. Install Anti-Spyware Program**

The best thing you can do is to install anti-spyware software on your device. These anti-spyware programs work by scanning the iPhone for spyware and deleting the programs. There are many such programs available but we advise to choose one with a reputation for efficiency. Anti-Spyware software will detect the spyware and ask you to uninstall it.

#### **2\. Update your iOS**

Another great way to get rid of spyware is to update your iOS. This is particularly helpful when you notice the Cydia app on your device and you didn’t jailbreak it. An update is effective because it often comes with bug fixes that may eliminate the spyware from your system.

To do it go to Settings > General > Software Update and tap “Download and Install.”

![Remove Spyware from iPhone-Update your iOS](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074749074576.jpg)

#### **3\. Restore your Device**

Restoring your iPhone in iTunes can also be quite effective in getting rid of spyware. Like an update, a restore often eliminates the spyware by deleting all bugs affecting the system. Be advised however that a restore will often erase all data and contents on the Motorola Moto G24 device so be sure to have a backup handy before doing this.

Considering how easy it is for someone to spy on you, the best thing you can do is remain vigilant. If you notice some of the signs we’ve mentioned in Part 2 above, take the necessary steps to remove the spyware. It is also important to avoid clicking on suspicious links especially in emails from people you don’t know.
