## Top 10 Telegram Spy Tools On Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 for Parents

While smartphones are certainly making your life easier, they are also inadvertently damaging those of your children. As more and more communication channels open up to one and all, reaching out has become mighty simple.

But for children -- particularly adolescents and teenagers -- the wrong kind of communication from their peers and friends may inevitably spell disaster. It calls for a situation where parents need to be more vigilant about their children and the kind of messages they receive or send out.

In other words, they compulsorily need to monitor their children’s tablets, smartphones and other gadgets to keep track of any unwarranted activity which may turn out to be detrimental to their future. The following spy tools will help you do the needful and have been prioritized according to their features, reliability, functionality and feedback received from users.

## Part 3: An Alternative: Try mSpy

Taking pictures and videos discreetly from your spy watch may seem grand and fanciful, like 007. But real spy work actually happens behind a computer screen. In the age of information technology, people keep all their most valuable information stored on phones. As such, if you have access to someone's phone, you have access to all their secrets. However, breaking into someone's phone doesn't require years of hacking and coding practice as most people believe. All you need is a decent app that can take care of everything for you. [mSpy](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6) is that app.

While there are a lot of other spy apps out there worth browsing through, both for Android and [iPhone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/track/iphone-monitoring.html), mSpy is the most reliable, reasonable, and feature-heavy of them all.

## 5 Ways to Track Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 without App

The Find My Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 app is a great addition to your iPhone, and as the name suggests helps you to not only track your phone in the event it is stolen, but also lock it so that it cannot be misused. But what if you don’ have the app installed? Does that mean that you have to bid adieu to your iPhone forever? Not really, because we are about to reveal to you 5 different ways to track your iPhone without app, so you can hopefully find your phone in the condition it went astray.

## Part 1: Solution 1 – Apple’s iCloud to the rescue

Take note that this solution will not work if you haven’t activated the Find My iPhone service when you set up your device. If you have, here’s how to go about it.

Step 1. Get started by heading over to iCloud, and logging in with your credentials.

If you are greeted with the two factor authentication process, which asks you to insert a code that was sent to your devices, you can simply skip it by heading to the quick access link at the bottom.

Step 2. From the dashboard, locate the Find iPhone icon on the second row and click on it.

Step 3. Hover over to the All Devices dropdown menu and choose your iPhone.

![choose your iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075181861335.jpg)

Step 4. The tracking process will now begin, and you should be able to see it displayed on an interactive map if successful.

## Part 2: Solution 2 - Google to the Rescue

Note that this solution will only work if you have Location Services enabled on your iPhone.

It’s no surprise that both Apple and the search giant are fond of gathering information on all sorts of things, most notably your location. Google stores this information on its Timeline, so without ado, head to the Google Timeline.

![head to the Google Timeline to track your iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/example-trip-google-timeline.png)

Step 2. Select the present date from the left hand panel.

Step 3. Scroll to the bottom of the timeline, and select the latest location update.

Step 4. If your location is the same as your previous updates, your phone hasn’t moved so you go and get it from that location. Contrarily, if your phone has moved, you should contact authorities, and not go after the thief alone because you never know the type of person they are.

## Part 3: Solution 3 - Using Google Photos to Track your iPhone

If the above Google features do not work for you, the search giant has one more service that can help aka Google Photos.

This option is somewhat complex, and requires that you have the Google Photos app installed with automatic upload turned on. Further, someone will have to take photos with your iPhone, and in the event it is actually stolen, this is highly unlikely.

Well, if you have the aforementioned prerequisites, head over to photos.google.com to visit your most recently uploaded photos. If you happen to notice any recent photos, click on them and check their location by clicking on the right sidebar. Again, if you do find the location using this method, it is best to contact your local authorities.

![Use Google Photos to Track your iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075191479909.jpg)

## Part 4: Solution 4. Have another iPhone? Use it to Track one that’s gone missing

This method requires that you have Find My Friend enabled on both your missing iPhone and the one you’re going to use to track it. Good news is that starting from iOS 9, this feature is stock and will already be installed on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 device.

Step 1. Open the Find My Friends app on the iPhone that you will use for the tracking, and then enable Share My Location by tapping on their contact picture located at the bottom.

Ensure that the location is being Shared From This Device as there may be other devices connected with the same iCloud account.

Step 2. Next enable AirDrop from the control center of your iPhone and make yourself discoverable to everyone. Further hit Add on the tracking iPhone, choose your contact icon and select Share Indefinitely.

Step 3. Once the tracking iPhone’s location is shared with your device, a popup will appear asking you how long you would like to share your location for, which is where you select Share Indefinitely.

![use another phone to track the missing one](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075192666907.jpg)

Step 4. When you’re ready to begin tracking, open up the Find My Friends app, click on their contact (your contact in this case) to see its exact location in real time.
