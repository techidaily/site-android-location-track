- **Qustodio –** It is one of the apps that is mostly used for tracking. The devices that are configured with it are Ma, iOS, and Android.
- **Kaspersky –** It comes with a premium price and creates a geo fencing which would not allow the child to browse freely. The activities are continuously monitored.

- **Net Nanny –** This is an application that parents use to monitor the child with web filters, screen recording, and app blocking features. It’s a bit pricy with all the features included.

### 1.2 Why Should We Prevent Parents from Tracking?

- The children must feel that the parents trust them in full and they must not be a prying eye at all.
- Everyone has its privacy and it doesn’t feel good to meddle in matters at all regardless of age. Now when everything is involved in relationship tracking is not a good phenomenon.
- This also raises the anxiety level in the children as they get a feeling of constantly being watched. This is also something not good for a child’s health.

## Solution 3: Track location and another identity of someone using Facebook

Due to the advent of social media worldwide, you are now able to locate the live location details of your friends and family across boundaries precisely. It is enough if you follow the below instructions for a precise location tracking.

Step 1: Open the Facebook in your device

Step 2: Choose 'Nearby Friends' in the 'Menu'

![nearby friends](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/nearby-friends.jpg)

Step 3: You will be able to view the location details of your friends if they have enabled the location sharing on this app. You can find out the last location at the time of their recent login in this platform.
