## How to Track Vivo Y27 5G by Phone Number

In most cases, tracking a lost iPhone has always been made possible thanks to the presence of tracking apps, and the use of the IMEI number. However, in the past few years, it has always been in the public domain and in the minds of many technocrats about the possibility of tracking an iPhone by only using its phone number (cellular number). Regardless of what has been said, tracking an iPhone using its number alone is a process that requires an in-depth understanding and application. In this article, we are going to take a look at the possibility of how to track an iPhone by phone number, as well as the use of the mSpy program to track a lost iPhone.

## Part 1: Is It Possible to Track An iPhone with Just the Number?

A lot of people have always asked me; is it possible to track my iPhone by phone number? Well; regardless of what people say out there, it is usually close to impossible to track your lost iPhone by primarily using only its phone number. In this case, the phone number in question is the number provided to you by your cellular provider. The moment you lose your iPhone, the chances of the thief changing your SIM card to another SIM card are high. This obviously makes it impossible to track your iPhone via a number that is no longer available. However, there's a leeway on how to track an iPhone by phone number though it depends on sheer chances and lack.

You can only track iPhone by phone number only if the culprit with the phone doesn’t change the SIM card. This is a sheer lack of procedure when you consider the fact that people nowadays steal phones and change the Sim cards as well as the IMEI numbers. If you want to track your iPhone in such cases, your only option would be to contact your cellular provider and ask them to perform a phone triangulation procedure or tell you if any calls were made using your number. Regardless of the type of iPhone tracking services, you might decide to use; the fact still remains that they can’t track your lost iPhone using the phone number. So don’t be duped by these companies or apps that claim to track your lost phone by using the phone number. What they can only do for you is to tell you the last position where the phone was detected, or if any calls were made and to whom. Basically, for you to trace your iPhone, you need its IMEI number, but not the phone number.

Next to the letter appears a text that indicates information about the parking in that zone.

Unfortunately, these options are not yet implemented on all Android and iOS smartphones. If our mobile phone does not yet have any of these features wait for the latest update as it is expected to be available on these operating systems very soon as a car locator device.

## Part 3. Tips on How to Choose the Best Anti-Tracking Software

The anti-tracker software included in the list above can surely help you protect your online privacy. However, don’t forget that each of them is different. That’s why you should choose the best one with the perfect set of web protection features that match your needs. To help you out, read the tips provided below and use them as your guide.

![safe internet browsing](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/anti-tracker-software-9.JPG)

- Choose the anti-tracker software that is easy to use. It should require complicated procedures to enable certain features. Moreover, the interface must be intuitive, along with the toolbars and other functions.
- The anti-tracker software should not downgrade the performance of your device. Web pages must continue to load normally. Another thing, web sessions must not be interrupted when the tracker blocker is activated.
- The anti-tracker software must provide comprehensive results with accurate information and meaningful evaluation. It must tell you head-on if your device is compromised and how to fix it.
- The anti-tracker software must be effective. Do some random tests to verify if your online information is completely cloaked when the application is enabled.
- Lastly, the company behind your selected anti-tracker software must provide great customer service. Take note that you’re paying for the subscription plan. Therefore, you deserve to be accommodated promptly when you try to reach them. On top of that, customer service representatives must also be trained enough to handle your concerns. They must be able to provide effective solutions to any issues related to the services they provide.

## Part 4. Keep Your Location Private With <u>Wondershare Dr.Fone.</u>

When it comes to your whereabouts, the anti-tracker software can somehow help you, too. However, the protection is not a hundred percent guaranteed, especially if the attacker employs highly advanced mechanisms. Some details referring to your exact location might remain traceable on their end. That’s why you should opt for alternative solutions with a much higher caliber. In this regard, Wondershare Dr.Fone has a lot to offer to you. It has a Virtual Location feature, allowing you to register another location on your mobile device and simulate GPS movements. Don’t worry. Like the anti-tracker software, it is also very easy to use. Do you want to try it now? Check out the tutorial below.



- **Step 1:** Download Wondershare Dr.Fone from its [<u>official website.</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) After that, install it on your computer.
- **Step 2:** Launch the newly installed application on your desktop. Once it fully loads up, connect your smartphone using a data cable.
