## Part 1: How do people track your phone?

There are several ways in which people can track the location of your phone. This can be risky at times, especially if you have a stalker. These are the common ways in which people track phones:

GPS location: all Smartphones come with a GPS chip, which continually gives the GPS location of your device. This is great for several features to work on the phone, but it can also be exploited by malicious people. The GPS location is also used to find lost devices or persons who are challenged in finding directions and may get lost. Therefore the GPS chip function is a double-edged sword.

IMEI information: This is information that can be tracked using data that is found on your mobile provider's servers. This is the information that law enforcers use to track crooks, and rescue teams use to track people lost in disaster zones. The IMEI gets recorded when your mobile device pings off mobile transmission towers that are nearby

The apps that are used by people to track mobile devices will track one of these two features. If you do not want to be tracked, then you have to find ways in which to disable these functions.

## Part 3:How to stop my android from being tracked

You also need to know how to stop Google from tracking your Honor Magic 6 Lite. This feature can be used to track your device through other apps.

### 1) Stop Google Tracking on Android device

- Access the "settings" app on your Home screen
- Now check your accounts until you find the "Google Account" option
- Tap on it and then scroll down to the "Manage Your Data & Personalization" option and tap on it
- You will find "Activity Controls" where you can pause or turn off the service altogether.
- If you want tighter control of the tracking features, You can also scroll down until you get to "Manage Your Activity Controls"
- Here you can delete all your past activity records so nobody can track you using your location history.

### 2) Turn off Android Location Tracking

Apart from stopping Google tracking on your device, you may also turn off Location tracking of other apps as shown below

- Start by going to your "Settings" app and then choosing "Security & Location"
- Scroll around and look for the "Use Location" option and then toggle it to the "OFF" position

Many people would stop at this time and think that their location is fully turned off, but this is not the case. The Android device could still be tracked using IMEI, Wi-Fi, and many other sensors. To disable these, go to the "advanced" option and then toggle off the following features:

Google Emergency Location Service. This is a service that tells emergency services where you are located when you dial the emergency service number.

Google Location Accuracy. This is a GPS feature that uses the Wi-Fi address and other services to show your location.

Google Location History. With this, you can switch off the collection of your location history.

Google Location Sharing. This will turn off location sharing if you use it to connect with friends and family.

### 3) Nord VPN

Nord VPN is a great tool to fake your GPS location and stop people from tracking your phone. It works by masking your true IP address and then using servers in another location to fake your position. This tool is great for stopping people from tracking you using browser-based apps. It also does affect the GPS chip and stop it from transmitting your true location. Nord VPN has servers in countries all over the world, which means you can move your location to another continent to fool those who may be tracking you.
