## How Do I Stop Someone From Tracking My Oppo Reno 11F 5G?

It has now become very easy to track a Smartphone using the GPS features of the phone. This can be done by tracking the phone number based on information derived from mobile carriers and also from the GPS chip on the phone which is used by certain apps in order to function well.

You may not want your GPS location tracked by anyone or by apps on your device. When playing games like Pokémon Go, the geo-location data on your device is used to pinpoint where you are for purposes of gameplay. In the same manner, malicious people can track you same way. Here you will learn how to stop someone from tracking your phone in simple and easy ways.

## Part 1: How do people track your phone?

There are several ways in which people can track the location of your phone. This can be risky at times, especially if you have a stalker. These are the common ways in which people track phones:

GPS location: all Smartphones come with a GPS chip, which continually gives the GPS location of your device. This is great for several features to work on the phone, but it can also be exploited by malicious people. The GPS location is also used to find lost devices or persons who are challenged in finding directions and may get lost. Therefore the GPS chip function is a double-edged sword.

IMEI information: This is information that can be tracked using data that is found on your mobile provider's servers. This is the information that law enforcers use to track crooks, and rescue teams use to track people lost in disaster zones. The IMEI gets recorded when your mobile device pings off mobile transmission towers that are nearby

The apps that are used by people to track mobile devices will track one of these two features. If you do not want to be tracked, then you have to find ways in which to disable these functions.

The sections below will show you how to stop someone from tracking your iPhone with ease.

- Now check your accounts until you find the "Google Account" option
- Tap on it and then scroll down to the "Manage Your Data & Personalization" option and tap on it

- Start by going to your "Settings" app and then choosing "Security & Location"
- Scroll around and look for the "Use Location" option and then toggle it to the "OFF" position

Many people would stop at this time and think that their location is fully turned off, but this is not the case. The Android device could still be tracked using IMEI, Wi-Fi, and many other sensors. To disable these, go to the "advanced" option and then toggle off the following features:

Google Emergency Location Service. This is a service that tells emergency services where you are located when you dial the emergency service number.

### 3) Nord VPN

Nord VPN is a great tool to fake your GPS location and stop people from tracking your phone. It works by masking your true IP address and then using servers in another location to fake your position. This tool is great for stopping people from tracking you using browser-based apps. It also does affect the GPS chip and stop it from transmitting your true location. Nord VPN has servers in countries all over the world, which means you can move your location to another continent to fool those who may be tracking you.

## Two Ways to Track My Boyfriend's Oppo Reno 11F 5G without Him Knowing

How can I track my boyfriend’s phone? If you also have the same question, then this would be the last post you’ll read. A while back, I was a little suspicious of my boyfriend’s behavior and wanted to track my boyfriend’s phone. As I did some research, I discovered that even though there are lots of spying tools out there, only a handful of them yields the desired results. I handpicked two apps to track my boyfriend and they certainly met my expectations. Therefore, I have provided a stepwise tutorial to use them right here.

## Part 1: How to Track My Boyfriend's Phone via mSpy?

When I wanted to learn how can I track my boyfriend’s phone, I tried various third-party solutions. I tried [mSpy](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH96F) .

![track my boyfriend’s phone-via mSpy](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082599886089.jpg)

1\. To use mSpy, you need to visit its website right [here](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH96F) and create your new account. Ideally, you need to follow similar steps as KidsGuard Pro’s installation to use mSpy.

2\. After creating your mSpy account and getting a paid subscription, you need to access the target device.

3\. Go to its Settings > Security and make sure that the option of downloading from Unknown Sources is turned on.

4\. Afterward, you can go to its website and download the app.

Even though mSpy provides similar features to that of KidsGuard Pro, it only works on rooted (and jailbroken) devices. Additionally, it is comparatively more expensive than KidsGuard Pro and doesn’t truly have a full-invisible mode. Any smart user can detect the spying app, which might land you in trouble.

## Part 2: How to Track My Boyfriend's Phone via KidsGuard Pro?

As I wanted to learn how can I track my boyfriend’s phone, I stumbled upon an amazing tool – [KidsGuard Pro](https://www.clevguard.com/android-parental-control/).

## How to Track Oppo Reno 11F 5G by Phone Number

In most cases, tracking a lost iPhone has always been made possible thanks to the presence of tracking apps, and the use of the IMEI number.

Regardless of what has been said, tracking an iPhone using its number alone is a process that requires an in-depth understanding and application. In this article, we are going to take a look at the possibility of how to track an iPhone by phone number, as well as the use of the mSpy program to track a lost iPhone.

## Part 1: Is It Possible to Track An iPhone with Just the Number?

A lot of people have always asked me; is it possible to track my iPhone by phone number? Well; regardless of what people say out there, it is usually close to impossible to track your lost iPhone by primarily using only its phone number. In this case, the phone number in question is the number provided to you by your cellular provider. The moment you lose your iPhone, the chances of the thief changing your SIM card to another SIM card are high. This obviously makes it impossible to track your iPhone via a number that is no longer available. However, there's a leeway on how to track an iPhone by phone number though it depends on sheer chances and lack.

You can only track iPhone by phone number only if the culprit with the phone doesn’t change the SIM card. This is a sheer lack of procedure when you consider the fact that people nowadays steal phones and change the Sim cards as well as the IMEI numbers. If you want to track your iPhone in such cases, your only option would be to contact your cellular provider and ask them to perform a phone triangulation procedure or tell you if any calls were made using your number. Regardless of the type of iPhone tracking services, you might decide to use; the fact still remains that they can’t track your lost iPhone using the phone number. So don’t be duped by these companies or apps that claim to track your lost phone by using the phone number. What they can only do for you is to tell you the last position where the phone was detected, or if any calls were made and to whom. Basically, for you to trace your iPhone, you need its IMEI number, but not the phone number.

## Part 2: How to Track iPhone Online via mSpy

Since it is impossible to track iPhone via the phone number, you can employ the use of secondary software and apps to track and primarily retrieve your iPhone from whoever has the phone. In this case, the application of [mSpy](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6) would be highly recommended. The mSpy program is a highly versatile program that can be used to perform various functions depending on the preferences of the user. In our case at hand, you can use this program to track your iPhone regardless of what part of the world the phone could have been taken to or located.

**TIP:** Please note that you can only track down your iPhone using mSpy by first installing the app on your phone. Without the installation process, tracking your phone using mSpy will be close to impossible.

Tracking a lost phone can be fun and at the same time a daunting task. The outcome or the general experience of tracking a lost phone will solely depend on the methods applied in the overall process. As we have seen in this article, though many people may argue that it is possible to track an iPhone by the number it is evident that the overall process can be problematic and in most cases, impossible. The only way out of tracking and finding your phone is by using the IMEI number. Any other number used for iPhone tracking purposes will only be for gathering information for investigative reasons.
