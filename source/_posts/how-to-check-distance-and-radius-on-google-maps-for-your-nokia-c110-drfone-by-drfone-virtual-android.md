## Part 1: Draw a Radius Circle on Google Maps

You might already know that Google Maps provides a map of the entire world for us to navigate. Though, there are times when users like to draw a radius on Google Maps for a particular location. Presently, the native feature of Google Maps does not have a distance radius tool. Therefore, to draw a radius on Google Maps, you would have to use an application that has its own interface. One of them is Map Developers that is based on Google Maps and has simply provided a solution to draw a radius on the map.

1. Firstly, just go to the official website of [Map Developers circle tool](https://www.mapdevelopers.com/draw-circle-tool.php) on any supported browser like Google Chrome. You can see that the website is based on Google Maps with its added layers to draw a radius on the map.

![google maps distance radius 2](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-2.jpg)

1. Now, just use the native feature of the map to zoom in to any location of your choice. You can also enter the name of the location that you are looking for in the search bar.
2. Besides that, you can also enter details about the radius of the circle, its color, and so on. After entering all the needed details, click on the “New Circle” button and it will be reflected on Google Maps interface.

![google maps distance radius 3](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-3.jpg)

If you want, you can later delete this circle or draw multiple circles in different colors to mark them in any location of your choice.

## Part 2: Determine the Distance with Radius on Google Maps

Apart from drawing a circle or radius on Google Maps, a lot of people would like to specify its distance as well. For instance, you might wish to specify a radius of specific miles or kilometers for a place on Google Maps. As stated above, the native feature of Google Maps is presently missing the distance radius feature. The good news is that there are tons of websites out there that have presented the same feature on the original layer of Google Maps.

- _Map Developers Radius_

Consider the example of the circle tool of Map Developers that we have discussed above. In this, you can just enter the name of a specific place on Google Maps. Now, you can specify the distance of radius in miles or kilometers. This will automatically draw the specific distance radius on Google Maps for the designated location.

![google maps distance radius 4](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-4.jpg)

- _KML Circle Generator_

If you know the exact longitude and latitude of the place, then you can also take the assistance of KML Circle Generator. In this, you would have to specify the exact coordinates of the place and the Google Maps distance radius value. After entering the relevant details, you can proceed and draw the radius distance on Google Maps.

![google maps distance radius 5](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-5.jpg)

## Part 3: Determine the Distance between two Addresses on Google Maps

This is one of the most resourceful features of Google Maps that a lot of people are not aware of. Using its native interface, you can find a straight line distance on Google Maps. That is, it won’t be the driving distance, but the exact distance between 2 places on Google Maps. If you want, you can add other spots to let Google Maps calculate distance between multiple locations as well. To learn how to measure distance between two addresses on Google Maps, follow these steps:

1. At first, just launch Google Maps on your system and go to the source location on it. You can click on any marked location or anywhere else on the map. Even if you click on any unmarked location, Google will load its coordinates for you.

![google maps distance radius 6](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-6.jpg)

1. Now, once the source location is identified, you need to right-click it to get its context menu. From the available options on the context menu, click on “Measure Distance”.

![google maps distance radius 7](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-7.jpg)

1. Afterward, just click anywhere else on the map and it will automatically find a straight line distance in Google Maps between these two spots.

![google maps distance radius 8](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-8.jpg)

1. If you want to continue, then just click anywhere else on the map and that will be considered as the next spot. Therefore, you can just click as many times as you want to let Google Maps calculate distance between multiple locations.

![google maps distance radius 9](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-9.jpg)

This technique will let you measure distance between any addresses on Google Maps. It doesn’t matter if it is your present location or not. If you want to measure distance in some other location, then just enter its name in the search bar to load it. In this way, you can measure distance anywhere in the world by sitting in your home.

This brings us to the end of this extensive guide on using Google Maps distance and radius features. As you can see, I have provided a smart and user-friendly solution to draw radius distance on Google Maps. Besides that, you can also follow the above guide to measure distance between two addresses on Google Maps.

## How to Track Nokia C110 by Phone Number

In most cases, tracking a lost iPhone has always been made possible thanks to the presence of tracking apps, and the use of the IMEI number. However, in the past few years, it has always been in the public domain and in the minds of many technocrats about the possibility of tracking an iPhone by only using its phone number (cellular number). Regardless of what has been said, tracking an iPhone using its number alone is a process that requires an in-depth understanding and application. In this article, we are going to take a look at the possibility of how to track an iPhone by phone number, as well as the use of the mSpy program to track a lost iPhone.

## Part 1: Is It Possible to Track An iPhone with Just the Number?

A lot of people have always asked me; is it possible to track my iPhone by phone number? Well; regardless of what people say out there, it is usually close to impossible to track your lost iPhone by primarily using only its phone number. In this case, the phone number in question is the number provided to you by your cellular provider. The moment you lose your iPhone, the chances of the thief changing your SIM card to another SIM card are high. This obviously makes it impossible to track your iPhone via a number that is no longer available. However, there's a leeway on how to track an iPhone by phone number though it depends on sheer chances and lack.

You can only track iPhone by phone number only if the culprit with the phone doesn’t change the SIM card. This is a sheer lack of procedure when you consider the fact that people nowadays steal phones and change the Sim cards as well as the IMEI numbers. If you want to track your iPhone in such cases, your only option would be to contact your cellular provider and ask them to perform a phone triangulation procedure or tell you if any calls were made using your number. Regardless of the type of iPhone tracking services, you might decide to use; the fact still remains that they can’t track your lost iPhone using the phone number. So don’t be duped by these companies or apps that claim to track your lost phone by using the phone number. What they can only do for you is to tell you the last position where the phone was detected, or if any calls were made and to whom. Basically, for you to trace your iPhone, you need its IMEI number, but not the phone number.

## Part 2: How to Track iPhone Online via mSpy

Since it is impossible to track iPhone via the phone number, you can employ the use of secondary software and apps to track and primarily retrieve your iPhone from whoever has the phone.

The mSpy program is a highly versatile program that can be used to perform various functions depending on the preferences of the user. In our case at hand, you can use this program to track your iPhone regardless of what part of the world the phone could have been taken to or located.

**TIP:** Please note that you can only track down your iPhone using mSpy by first installing the app on your phone. Without the installation process, tracking your phone using mSpy will be close to impossible.

Tracking a lost phone can be fun and at the same time a daunting task. The outcome or the general experience of tracking a lost phone will solely depend on the methods applied in the overall process. As we have seen in this article, though many people may argue that it is possible to track an iPhone by the number it is evident that the overall process can be problematic and in most cases, impossible. The only way out of tracking and finding your phone is by using the IMEI number. Any other number used for iPhone tracking purposes will only be for gathering information for investigative reasons.

## Option 4: Google Maps (It will be available in the next version)

Introduction: This application is implementing new features for drivers to find parking more easily. It tries to help those forgetful drivers who park but then do not know where they parked the vehicle. For them, Maps is responsible for collecting information on the time in which they have been stopped after moving by car, if we have the mobile connected to the car by Bluetooth, the application understands that we have been using a vehicle, and shows the parking with a round blue icon with a capital P inside. If this does not appear, it can also be saved in another way. Once parked you can open the map of the application and click on the blue point of location. At that time it gives us the option to Save your parking leaving the blue icon mentioned above.

The second functionality of Google Maps in developing is the option to know where we can find available parking. In addition to the information collected by the application of our travels, it is able to show the most traveled places and with or greater parking so it can inform you where you are most likely to find parking. How does it work? A small red icon with a blank P appears next to the destination that we selected in our search. Next to the letter appears a text that indicates information about the parking in that zone.

Unfortunately, these options are not yet implemented on all Android and iOS smartphones. If our mobile phone does not yet have any of these features wait for the latest update as it is expected to be available on these operating systems very soon as a car locator device.
