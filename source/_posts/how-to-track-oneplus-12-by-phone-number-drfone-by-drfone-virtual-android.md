A lot of people have always asked me; is it possible to track my iPhone by phone number? Well; regardless of what people say out there, it is usually close to impossible to track your lost iPhone by primarily using only its phone number.

So don’t be duped by these companies or apps that claim to track your lost phone by using the phone number.
