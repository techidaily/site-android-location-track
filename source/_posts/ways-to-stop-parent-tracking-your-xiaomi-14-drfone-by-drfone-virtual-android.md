But what if you don’ have the app installed? Does that mean that you have to bid adieu to your iPhone forever? Not really, because we are about to reveal to you 5 different ways to track your iPhone without app, so you can hopefully find your phone in the condition it went astray.

## Part 1: Solution 1 – Apple’s iCloud to the rescue

Take note that this solution will not work if you haven’t activated the Find My iPhone service when you set up your device. If you have, here’s how to go about it.

Step 1. Get started by heading over to iCloud, and logging in with your credentials.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://proteahair.pxf.io/c/5597632/1983634/23621" target="_top" id="1983634"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23621-1983634" border="0" alt="" width="320" height="100"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983634/23621" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![sign in to iCloud](https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/article/2017/10/icloud.com-login.jpg)

If you are greeted with the two factor authentication process, which asks you to insert a code that was sent to your devices, you can simply skip it by heading to the quick access link at the bottom.

![skip the two factor authentication process](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075180348414.jpg) ![head to the quick access link](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075180363658.jpg)

Step 2. From the dashboard, locate the Find iPhone icon on the second row and click on it.

![locate the Find iPhone icon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075181495657.jpg)

Step 3. Hover over to the All Devices dropdown menu and choose your iPhone.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![begin to track the phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075182429793.jpg)

Step 5. Once you know the exact location of your device, you can do one of three things—activate lost mode, trigger an acoustic signal or erase all data.

## Part 2: Solution 2 - Google to the Rescue

Note that this solution will only work if you have Location Services enabled on your iPhone.

It’s no surprise that both Apple and the search giant are fond of gathering information on all sorts of things, most notably your location. Google stores this information on its Timeline, so without ado, head to the Google Timeline.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://dhgate.sjv.io/c/5597632/1678785/12108" target="_top" id="1678785"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/12108-1678785" border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"/></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![head to the Google Timeline to track your iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/example-trip-google-timeline.png)

Step 2. Select the present date from the left hand panel.

Step 3. Scroll to the bottom of the timeline, and select the latest location update.

Step 4. If your location is the same as your previous updates, your phone hasn’t moved so you go and get it from that location. Contrarily, if your phone has moved, you should contact authorities, and not go after the thief alone because you never know the type of person they are.

## Part 3: Solution 3 - Using Google Photos to Track your iPhone

If the above Google features do not work for you, the search giant has one more service that can help aka Google Photos.

This option is somewhat complex, and requires that you have the Google Photos app installed with automatic upload turned on. Further, someone will have to take photos with your iPhone, and in the event it is actually stolen, this is highly unlikely.

Well, if you have the aforementioned prerequisites, head over to photos.google.com to visit your most recently uploaded photos. If you happen to notice any recent photos, click on them and check their location by clicking on the right sidebar. Again, if you do find the location using this method, it is best to contact your local authorities.

![Use Google Photos to Track your iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075191479909.jpg)

## Part 4: Solution 4. Have another iPhone? Use it to Track one that’s gone missing

This method requires that you have Find My Friend enabled on both your missing iPhone and the one you’re going to use to track it. Good news is that starting from iOS 9, this feature is stock and will already be installed on the Xiaomi 14 device.

Step 1. Open the Find My Friends app on the iPhone that you will use for the tracking, and then enable Share My Location by tapping on their contact picture located at the bottom.

Ensure that the location is being Shared From This Device as there may be other devices connected with the same iCloud account.

Step 2. Next enable AirDrop from the control center of your iPhone and make yourself discoverable to everyone. Further hit Add on the tracking iPhone, choose your contact icon and select Share Indefinitely.

Step 3. Once the tracking iPhone’s location is shared with your device, a popup will appear asking you how long you would like to share your location for, which is where you select Share Indefinitely.

## 4\. Caller ID & Number Locator

This app takes the cup for the day. With the phone number locator feature, it also comes with a call identifier.

With this, you can search and pinpoint the location of any mobile number or a fixed-line phone number in the world. This locator will run a database check to pull the exact location out for you, and moreover, it prints the same on the Google map to show you the target's phone's geographical location! Sounds cool, eh?

**Features**

- This software works through a database of added information on more than 12,982 cities.
- The call identifier feature will let you in on the real caller before you can answer the phone.
- There is also the option of a call blocker in case your caller gets too annoying to handle! (Or too offensive.)

- This app has spread its wings over 200 countries globally.
- The location of the caller and the caller ID is viewable.
- With the caller blocker feature, it's possible to block any annoying caller.
- The availability of a Google map positioning technology makes it easier to pinpoint the exact location.

**Cons**

- It doesn't work on Android versions below 4.0.

## 5\. Truecaller

This is noted as the best leading app over the globe. There must be some better features compared to the previous ones if that's the case, yes?

It is cited to be the best caller ID app and it even blocks danger-rangers, their calls, and SMS. You can identify the person or the company that calls you before picking up. Be it landlines, mobile, or pre-paid even if you don't have the contact stored in your device!

You don't have to worry about telemarketers calling you or robocalls anymore. Spammers can't make an appearance ever again and consider yourself safe for life.

![phone number locator-Truecaller](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/11/15099056551018.jpg)

- This renowned app has got a block feature.
- This is the best- you can view the caller's profile that includes their name and photo!
- There is also a contact directory that will help you find an unknown number.
- You need not worry if your phonebook contacts get uploaded- this is an impossibility where Truecaller is concerned.
- If you end up calling the wrong number, they might search you up (!) and you would definitely know it too. Another perk!
- This app undoubtedly offers the best tracking services.

**Pros**

- Your phonebook contacts won't be uploaded online.
- It's easy to know if you were searched online (or, your number for that matter).
- It's possible to make calls directly from the app.
- This app has got over 200 million users as it offers the most trusted and efficient services to make their customers happy.

**Cons**

- It requests an Internet connection.
- You must supply your phone number to the makers for this app to work.

It's really quick in showing the results, details, and that's what makes this app a popular one.

Where do you think these creators of number locators gather all this personal information from? It's absolutely frightening to think of how they would get hold of our information, isn't it? But, that's a topic for another day. It's certainly helpful if one doesn't misuse this information for their own personal gain now, right?
