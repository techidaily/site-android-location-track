## Part 1: How to know whether your text message has been intercepted?

Intercepting a target phone could give us the controls and allow us to spy on various activities happening on the target phone even to the extent of giving us information about what’s happening in the surrounding. It does this by listening to the conversation by turning on the microphone even when the target phone is not in use. So, while the spying application keeps running in the background silently, text messages can be easily intercepted. So, it is imperative to know and read the signs to actually get to know if your text messages are being intercepted. There are some signs which could give you an idea if your text message has been intercepted.

**Odd Phone Behavior** – If your phone is behaving erratic and lights up suddenly even when not in use, it is possible that the cell phone is being intercepted. Some other signs could be random beeping noise, phone shutting down by itself, etc. While this might happen normally at times, if it is happening on a regular basis, there is a chance that the phone text message or for that matter phone data is being intercepted.

**Battery Rundown** – Some spy software running in the background can consume a lot of battery charge. If there is a dramatic change in the battery consumption and the phone now needs charging more often, it might mean that text messages or the phone is being intercepted.

**Phone Shuts down** – If your phone regularly shuts down by itself, even if the battery is fully charged, there could be one spy application running on the phone.

**Increased data usage** – If you see a dramatic increase in the consumption of data, it could be due to the spy application running silently in the background. The spy applications constantly send the recorded text message logs and data from the target phone which increases data consumption.

So, these are some signs which could suggest that your text message has been intercepted.

Intercepting text messages is now very easy using a robust application which can intercept any device in some simple steps. Moreover, the application can be used with both iOS and Android devices.

## Part 2: Intercepting text messages from both iOS and Android phones

**mSpy:**

[mSpy](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6) is a popular application that is compatible with both iPhone and Android. mSpy for the phone has all the features which make this application a unique one to go for. mSpy for phones could give information regarding text messages on the target device and chats. Moreover, mSpy also gives information about call logs and contacts along with access to the IM chats like WhatsApp monitoring, Snapchat monitoring, etc. mSpy also allows you to view the photos and videos taken or stored or just viewed on the target device. mSpy can remotely erase the targeted phone’s data. This feature helps when the phone is stolen. Installing mSpy on the target phone is extremely simple and involves very few steps. So, it takes a few minutes to install the application on the target phone. mSpy works with iPhone as well as Android phones. So, text message interception is possible with both iPhone and Android using mSpy.

**Using mSpy to intercept text messages from other phones**

To be able to intercept text messages from other phones, it is first required to install the mSpy application on the target phone that has to be intercepted. Here are some steps to intercept text messages using mSpy from other phones:

**1\. Install mSpy and set it up**

To start the process, buy mSpy that has to be installed on the target device. mSpy requires account creation and activation. This account with login credentials will be later used to monitor all the activities. You will be asked for an email id in which you will receive the setup procedure.

## Part 3: What you need to know when using mSpy

**Few things to know when using [mSpy](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6):**

While the working, installation, and setting up of mSpy is very easy, there are a few things that need to be kept in mind while using mSpy.

1\. While it is possible to remotely access data, monitor, and control the target device, it is imperative to have physical access to the target device to install the application, grant permissions, and set the application up. This is a one-time task that needs to be done before you start accessing the target device records remotely from other devices using the browser.

2\. If the target device is iPhone or iPad, the target device must be jailbroken for mSpy to be used.

3\. The target device must be connected to the internet. mSpy will constantly send information pertaining to text messages or SMS, call logs, WhatsApp messages, etc from the target device to the control panel while it is connected to the internet.

So, these are the ways to install and start intercepting text messages both for iOS and Android using mSpy and we also listed down a few things that have to be kept in mind while going for mSpy. Hope this helps you in successfully and safely intercepting text messages.

- **Qustodio –** It is one of the apps that is mostly used for tracking. The devices that are configured with it are Ma, iOS, and Android.
- **Kaspersky –** It comes with a premium price and creates a geo fencing which would not allow the child to browse freely. The activities are continuously monitored.

- **Net Nanny –** This is an application that parents use to monitor the child with web filters, screen recording, and app blocking features. It’s a bit pricy with all the features included.

### 1.2 Why Should We Prevent Parents from Tracking?

- The children must feel that the parents trust them in full and they must not be a prying eye at all.
- Everyone has its privacy and it doesn’t feel good to meddle in matters at all regardless of age. Now when everything is involved in relationship tracking is not a good phenomenon.
- This also raises the anxiety level in the children as they get a feeling of constantly being watched. This is also something not good for a child’s health.

## How Do I Stop Someone From Tracking My Xiaomi 13 Ultra?

It has now become very easy to track a Smartphone using the GPS features of the phone. This can be done by tracking the phone number based on information derived from mobile carriers and also from the GPS chip on the phone which is used by certain apps in order to function well.

You may not want your GPS location tracked by anyone or by apps on your device. When playing games like Pokémon Go, the geo-location data on your device is used to pinpoint where you are for purposes of gameplay. In the same manner, malicious people can track you same way. Here you will learn how to stop someone from tracking your phone in simple and easy ways.

## Part 1: How do people track your phone?

There are several ways in which people can track the location of your phone. This can be risky at times, especially if you have a stalker. These are the common ways in which people track phones:

GPS location: all Smartphones come with a GPS chip, which continually gives the GPS location of your device. This is great for several features to work on the phone, but it can also be exploited by malicious people. The GPS location is also used to find lost devices or persons who are challenged in finding directions and may get lost. Therefore the GPS chip function is a double-edged sword.

IMEI information: This is information that can be tracked using data that is found on your mobile provider's servers. This is the information that law enforcers use to track crooks, and rescue teams use to track people lost in disaster zones. The IMEI gets recorded when your mobile device pings off mobile transmission towers that are nearby

The apps that are used by people to track mobile devices will track one of these two features. If you do not want to be tracked, then you have to find ways in which to disable these functions.

The sections below will show you how to stop someone from tracking your iPhone with ease.

## Part 3:How to stop my android from being tracked

You also need to know how to stop Google from tracking your Xiaomi 13 Ultra. This feature can be used to track your device through other apps.

### 1) Stop Google Tracking on Android device

- Access the "settings" app on your Home screen
- Now check your accounts until you find the "Google Account" option
- Tap on it and then scroll down to the "Manage Your Data & Personalization" option and tap on it
- You will find "Activity Controls" where you can pause or turn off the service altogether.
- If you want tighter control of the tracking features, You can also scroll down until you get to "Manage Your Activity Controls"
- Here you can delete all your past activity records so nobody can track you using your location history.

### 2) Turn off Android Location Tracking

Apart from stopping Google tracking on your device, you may also turn off Location tracking of other apps as shown below

- Start by going to your "Settings" app and then choosing "Security & Location"
- Scroll around and look for the "Use Location" option and then toggle it to the "OFF" position

Many people would stop at this time and think that their location is fully turned off, but this is not the case. The Android device could still be tracked using IMEI, Wi-Fi, and many other sensors. To disable these, go to the "advanced" option and then toggle off the following features:

Google Emergency Location Service. This is a service that tells emergency services where you are located when you dial the emergency service number.

Google Location Accuracy. This is a GPS feature that uses the Wi-Fi address and other services to show your location.

Google Location History. With this, you can switch off the collection of your location history.

Google Location Sharing. This will turn off location sharing if you use it to connect with friends and family.

### 3) Nord VPN

Nord VPN is a great tool to fake your GPS location and stop people from tracking your phone. It works by masking your true IP address and then using servers in another location to fake your position. This tool is great for stopping people from tracking you using browser-based apps. It also does affect the GPS chip and stop it from transmitting your true location. Nord VPN has servers in countries all over the world, which means you can move your location to another continent to fool those who may be tracking you.
