## How to Intercept Text Messages on Realme 11 Pro

With the increase in the use of smartphones nowadays, the applications for smartphones have gone on to become equally smarter. For instance, text messages which are one of the most important components of every phone, can now be easily intercepted or spied on, courtesy some smart applications. Yes, it is a matter of minutes now to be able to spy on or intercept text messages even when not having the target device in your possession. Moreover, there are applications that work on all platforms whether it is android or iOS. But how do you intercept text messages? Well, if this is what’s playing in your mind; you are absolutely at the right place. In this article, we are going to discuss ways to intercept text messages from both iOS and Android Phones and how to know whether your text messages have been intercepted.

![fake GPS of mobile device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

## Part 1: How to know whether your text message has been intercepted?

Intercepting a target phone could give us the controls and allow us to spy on various activities happening on the target phone even to the extent of giving us information about what’s happening in the surrounding. It does this by listening to the conversation by turning on the microphone even when the target phone is not in use. So, while the spying application keeps running in the background silently, text messages can be easily intercepted. So, it is imperative to know and read the signs to actually get to know if your text messages are being intercepted. There are some signs which could give you an idea if your text message has been intercepted.

**Odd Phone Behavior** – If your phone is behaving erratic and lights up suddenly even when not in use, it is possible that the cell phone is being intercepted. Some other signs could be random beeping noise, phone shutting down by itself, etc. While this might happen normally at times, if it is happening on a regular basis, there is a chance that the phone text message or for that matter phone data is being intercepted.

**Battery Rundown** – Some spy software running in the background can consume a lot of battery charge. If there is a dramatic change in the battery consumption and the phone now needs charging more often, it might mean that text messages or the phone is being intercepted.

**Phone Shuts down** – If your phone regularly shuts down by itself, even if the battery is fully charged, there could be one spy application running on the phone.

**Increased data usage** – If you see a dramatic increase in the consumption of data, it could be due to the spy application running silently in the background. The spy applications constantly send the recorded text message logs and data from the target phone which increases data consumption.

So, these are some signs which could suggest that your text message has been intercepted.

Intercepting text messages is now very easy using a robust application which can intercept any device in some simple steps. Moreover, the application can be used with both iOS and Android devices.

## Part 2: Intercepting text messages from both iOS and Android phones

**mSpy:**

So, it takes a few minutes to install the application on the target phone. mSpy works with iPhone as well as Android phones. So, text message interception is possible with both iPhone and Android using mSpy.

**Using mSpy to intercept text messages from other phones**

While the working, installation, and setting up of mSpy is very easy, there are a few things that need to be kept in mind while using mSpy.

2\. If the target device is iPhone or iPad, the target device must be jailbroken for mSpy to be used.
