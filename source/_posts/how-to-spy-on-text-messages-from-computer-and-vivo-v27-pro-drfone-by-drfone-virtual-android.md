- The children must feel that the parents trust them in full and they must not be a prying eye at all.
- Everyone has its privacy and it doesn’t feel good to meddle in matters at all regardless of age. Now when everything is involved in relationship tracking is not a good phenomenon.
- This also raises the anxiety level in the children as they get a feeling of constantly being watched. This is also something not good for a child’s health.

South Korea to regulate and safeguard teenage activities online have come up with an innovative law. It has made control of teenagers' phones a law and has determined that children, under the age of 19 who purchases a mobile phone are required to install an app that monitors their Internet activity. A failure or "forgetfulness" in the installation of such a surveillance system means that the newly purchased device would not work. In case you do not live in this country but still, you need to track your kid's device, do not doubt, use one of our iPhone monitoring apps for any emergency case and protect your kids from unwarranted exposure.
