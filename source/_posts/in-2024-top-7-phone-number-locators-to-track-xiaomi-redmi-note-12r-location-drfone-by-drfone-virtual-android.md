## Part 1: How to Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak

The majority of spy apps in the market will only work on a jailbroken device or require you to jailbreak an iPhone before you can use them. While a jailbroken device does have its advantages, it can be quite problematic when you want to spy on an iPhone without alerting the owner to your activities. To begin with, you must have the iPhone to jailbreak it, a factor that makes it easier to get caught trying to spy on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R device. Also, it is quite possible no matter how hard you try to hide the jailbreaking app that the owner will realize you have jailbroken their device.

For the best results you want to use a monitoring program that doesn’t require a jailbroken device to work. The best is [mSpy](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6), a monitoring program that will work on any iPhone and provide you with detailed information without the need to jailbreak the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R device. Here’s how to use mSpy to spy on an iPhone.

Step 1: Begin by activating iCloud Backup on the target device. Go to Settings and then select “iCloud” to do this. Using mSpy will require iCloud to be activated.

![Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak-activate iCloud Backup](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079744896475.jpg)

Step 2: The first step is to create an account with mSpy. You can then purchase a subscription based on the type of information you need from the target device and the duration you want to spend spying on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R device.

![Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak-create an account with mSpy](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079746911961.jpg)

Step 3: Once you’ve registered and purchased the subscription, you will receive an email from mSpy with all the information you need to install the program.

Step 4: You can then log in to your [mSpy](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6) control panel and add the Apple ID and password of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R device to gain access to the information you need on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R device.

## Part 2: How to Spy using Spyware that Requires a Jailbreak

Being able to spy on an iPhone without a jailbreak is not something that happens often. This is because unlike mSpy, most monitoring software will require you jailbreak the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R device before you can install the software. One of those apps is TruthSpy. Like mSpy, this app will allow users to see all types of data on the target device without the owner of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R device knowing they are being monitored. The only problem is, you need to have access to the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R device to jailbreak it. If this is what you prefer or are unable to get access to mSpy, TruthSpy will work just fine. Here’s how to use it.

Step 1: Begin by performing a jailbreak on the target device. There are several options to help you do that like Pangu software.

![Spy using Spyware with jailbreak-Pangu software](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074779011456.jpg)

Step 2: Once the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R device is successfully jailbroken, create an account with TruthSpy, purchase a subscription and you will receive instructions on how to install the software on the jailbroken device.

Step 3: You can then log in to TurthSpy with your log in information and access all types of data on the target iPhone from any bowser.

![Spy using Spyware with jailbreak-log in to TurthSpy](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079742762274.jpg)

Both mSpy and TruthSpy will provide you with all the information you need about the target device. The only difference is, you need to jailbreak the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R device if TruthSpy will be able to access it. Jailbreaking the

device will however make it easier for the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R device’s owner to find the spyware and remove it before you are able to complete your activities. It is therefore preferable to use a program like mSpy that requires no jailbreak.

Note: If you want to hide the “Find my friends” app from the target device you can use the dock method which will be easy but the folder method is very tough.

## Part 4: Frequently Asked Questions

**1\. What is rooting? Does it have a warranty? Any rooting between Android and mSpy?**

Rooting is obviously known as the control between Android users and Android subsystems. It has a warranty period and rooting is applicable if you track WhatsApp, Facebook messages.

**2\. How one can detect the software to monitor on an Android device?**

mSpy is authorized and certified software and it has to run legally on both user and the target device. If the illegal process is found, you can assist customer support immediately.

**3\. If the phone was stolen, can I find My Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R using the number?**

mSpy activates if installed on the iPhone completely. The process of finding the phone using a number is not applicable in mSpy.

We must tell you using mSpy and FlexiSPY are both one of the best methods to track a cell phone. Both the applications have several metrics and would certainly assist in how to track a cell phone without them knowing. We know that tracking a cell phone without them knowing is illegal, but when it comes to our children's safety we have to do this at any cost.
