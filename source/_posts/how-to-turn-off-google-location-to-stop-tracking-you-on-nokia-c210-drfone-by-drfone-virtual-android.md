## How to Turn Off Google Location to Stop Tracking You on Nokia C210

The location services that Google provides to Android smartphones are indeed useful in many ways. For instance, you can use Google Maps to check a particular place you want to visit and obtain reliable directions to help you get there. Another thing, Google can also give you the exact location of your Nokia C210 in case you lost it somewhere. Indeed, Google’s GPS tracking feature comes in very handy whenever you need such assistance.

It’s true to say that Google's location monitoring services offer tons of benefits to us. But at some point, we cannot deny that activating this feature somehow entails a certain privacy and security risk. That’s why many users opt to **turn off Google location tracking** and keep their whereabouts private. Don’t worry. It’s totally fine. You can implement such measures, too, if you’re uncomfortable sharing your location details with Google. All it takes to turn off Google location tracking is just a few taps on your mobile device.

In this article, we will discuss how Google employs location access on your mobile device. We will also provide some quick tutorials on how to turn off Google location tracking in easy steps. Continue reading below to learn more.

## Part 1. Understanding How Google Uses Location Data

Location data generally helps us find reliable directions and pinpoint a particular place. But apart from that, this piece of information actually serves a bigger purpose. Google, in particular, employs location data to provide high-quality services tailored to specific preferences and necessities of the users. Each Google product relies heavily on location information and utilizes it for various reasons. To understand it better, check out the list below.

### It is an essential component of most Google services

![google products](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-1.JPG)

Of course, Google Maps and Weather will not work without access to location data. It is the main component that allows this kind of application to function exactly as it should. That’s why you should think twice before you turn off Google location tracking. Keep it activated on your mobile device if you’re in need of real-time weather updates or reliable coordinates.

### It is used for targeted advertisements

The majority of online advertisements scattered all over the internet are run by Google. It uses location data to ensure the ads that appear on your web browser are relevant to your personal liking. For example, Google Ads will likely flash American products on your smartphones if you’re located in that particular region. Do you want to keep it that way? If so, you should not then turn off Google location tracking on your Nokia C210 smartphone.

### It is used by Google to provide accurate search results

![google search results](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-2.JPG)

The same thing goes for Google search results. This query engine uses location data to provide information relevant to the specific needs of the user. Let’s say you’re currently residing in Japan and looking for nearby coffee shops. Of course, it will be unhelpful if Google dispenses a list of coffee shops that aren’t located in your country. That’s why you shouldn’t turn off Google location tracking on your smartphone if you’re looking for precise and pertinent answers.

### It is used by Google to implement certain security protocols

Google uses location data to keep your accounts safe from potential attacks and security breaches. How so? Well, Google immediately sends alerts whenever your account is used from an unusual location. Another thing is that strange activities on your account are promptly detected with the aid of location information. Simply put, allowing Google to access your whereabouts is the least you can do to protect your digital assets. Hence, don’t turn off Google location tracking on your Nokia C210 smartphone if you need such assistance.

### It is utilized for research and further improvements of Google services

![google services](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-3.JPG)

We all know that Google is committed to offering us new products and improving its existing services. That’s indeed beneficial to all of us, especially in today’s ever-changing world. But definitely, it’s not possible if Google doesn’t have adequate location information from the pool of its users. Why so? Simply because location data determines the latest community trends and helps specialists find the perfect basis for fresh developments. Do you want to contribute something to the advancement of Google products? If so, you can start by giving Google access to the location data on your Nokia C210 smartphone.

## Part 2. Top 4 Techniques to Turn Off Google Location Tracking on Android

There’s no denying that Google uses location information to give us the best experience possible. However, it doesn’t necessarily mean there is no risk at all.
