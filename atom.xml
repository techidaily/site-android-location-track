This app comes with the facility to get a notification when the target person arrives or leaves a place. Here, if you have access to the target device and the “Find my friends” option then it will give you the solution on how to track a cell phone without them knowing.</p><p>Step1: Enable the option “Share my location” on the target phone. To enable share my location, open the app “Find my friends” &gt; Go for the contact’s photo &gt; “Share my location”.</p><p>Step 2: Generally iCloud account has sharing options for all other devices. We have to ensure the sharing option is correctly viewed as the target device such as “This device”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/11/15100182891050.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone without them knowing-share my location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Now swipe from bottom to end, click on the “Airdrop” option from the settings.

Now your contact picture will get displayed. Click on your profile photo &gt; select the option “Share indefinitely” to track a cell phone without them knowing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/11/15100183209840.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone without them knowing-Share indefinitely"                ></p><p>Step 5: The target device location will be shared with you.

Using its native interface, you can find a straight line distance on Google Maps. That is, it won’t be the driving distance, but the exact distance between 2 places on Google Maps. If you want, you can add other spots to let Google Maps calculate distance between multiple locations as well. To learn how to measure distance between two addresses on Google Maps, follow these steps:</p><ol><li>At first, just launch Google Maps on your system and go to the source location on it.

The problem is, there are some spy programs that will only work on a jailbroken device. This can be a problem when you don’t want the Honor X7b device’s owner to know of your activities and the owner has no intention to jailbreak their device.</p><p>In this article, we look at how you to spy on an iPhone without needing a jailbreak and how to spy on a jailbroken device or jailbreak a device to facilitate spying.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3727260&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.aiseesoft.com/avangate/30p/banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Spy-on-iPhone-without-Jailbreak"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Spy-on-iPhone-without-Jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak"></a>Part 1: How to Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak</h2><p>The majority of spy apps in the market will only work on a jailbroken device or require you to jailbreak an iPhone before you can use them. While a jailbroken device does have its advantages, it can be quite problematic when you want to spy on an iPhone without alerting the owner to your activities. To begin with, you must have the iPhone to jailbreak it, a factor that makes it easier to get caught trying to spy on the Honor X7b device. Also, it is quite possible no matter how hard you try to hide the jailbreaking app that the owner will realize you have jailbroken their device.</p><p>For the best results you want to use a monitoring program that doesn’t require a jailbroken device to work. The best is <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a monitoring program that will work on any iPhone and provide you with detailed information without the need to jailbreak the Honor X7b device.

This is because unlike mSpy, most monitoring software will require you jailbreak the Honor X7b device before you can install the software. One of those apps is TruthSpy. Like mSpy, this app will allow users to see all types of data on the target device without the owner of the Honor X7b device knowing they are being monitored. The only problem is, you need to have access to the Honor X7b device to jailbreak it. If this is what you prefer or are unable to get access to mSpy, TruthSpy will work just fine. Here’s how to use it.</p><p>Step 1: Begin by performing a jailbreak on the target device. There are several options to help you do that like Pangu software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074779011456.jpg"                      alt="Spy using Spyware with jailbreak-Pangu software"                ></p><p>Step 2: Once the Honor X7b device is successfully jailbroken, create an account with TruthSpy, purchase a subscription and you will receive instructions on how to install the software on the jailbroken device.</p><p>Step 3: You can then log in to TurthSpy with your log in information and access all types of data on the target iPhone from any bowser.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079742762274.jpg"                      alt="Spy using Spyware with jailbreak-log in to TurthSpy"                ></p><p>Both mSpy and TruthSpy will provide you with all the information you need about the target device. The only difference is, you need to jailbreak the Honor X7b device if TruthSpy will be able to access it. Jailbreaking the</p><p>device will however make it easier for the Honor X7b device’s owner to find the spyware and remove it before you are able to complete your activities. It is therefore preferable to use a program like mSpy that requires no jailbreak.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4940317&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/333ac5d90817d69113471fbb6e531bee/sps-partnership-728x90eng.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Track-WhatsApp-Messages-on-Honor-X7b-Without-Them-Knowing"><a href="#How-to-Track-WhatsApp-Messages-on-Honor-X7b-Without-Them-Knowing" class="headerlink" title="How to Track WhatsApp Messages on Honor X7b Without Them Knowing?"></a>How to Track WhatsApp Messages on Honor X7b Without Them Knowing?</h2><p>Apps for messaging, such as WhatsApp, have transformed how people communicate.

WhatsApp messages are end-to-end encrypted for all users. This means that they are only accessible on the Honor X7b device where the account was registered. To track someone’s WhatsApp messages, you would generally need to install monitoring software. Along with that, you should gain physical access to their device to set up monitoring tools.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>Can I track WhatsApp messages if they are backed up on iCloud?</strong></li></ol><p>WhatsApp provides users with the option to back up their chat history to iCloud. While these backups can help restore chats, they are not designed for real-time tracking purposes. To access the conversations in the backup files, you will need to use a tool or service with decryption capabilities. It is due to the fact that WhatsApp chats are end-to-end encrypted.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In conclusion, tracking WhatsApp messages can be helpful in various scenarios.

It does this by listening to the conversation by turning on the microphone even when the target phone is not in use. So, while the spying application keeps running in the background silently, text messages can be easily intercepted. So, it is imperative to know and read the signs to actually get to know if your text messages are being intercepted. There are some signs which could give you an idea if your text message has been intercepted.</p><p><strong>Odd Phone Behavior</strong> – If your phone is behaving erratic and lights up suddenly even when not in use, it is possible that the cell phone is being intercepted. Some other signs could be random beeping noise, phone shutting down by itself, etc. While this might happen normally at times, if it is happening on a regular basis, there is a chance that the phone text message or for that matter phone data is being intercepted.</p><p><strong>Battery Rundown</strong> – Some spy software running in the background can consume a lot of battery charge. If there is a dramatic change in the battery consumption and the phone now needs charging more often, it might mean that text messages or the phone is being intercepted.</p><p><strong>Phone Shuts down</strong> – If your phone regularly shuts down by itself, even if the battery is fully charged, there could be one spy application running on the phone.</p><p><strong>Increased data usage</strong> – If you see a dramatic increase in the consumption of data, it could be due to the spy application running silently in the background. The spy applications constantly send the recorded text message logs and data from the target phone which increases data consumption.</p><p>So, these are some signs which could suggest that your text message has been intercepted.</p><p>Intercepting text messages is now very easy using a robust application which can intercept any device in some simple steps.

While it is possible to remotely access data, monitor, and control the target device, it is imperative to have physical access to the target device to install the application, grant permissions, and set the application up. This is a one-time task that needs to be done before you start accessing the target device records remotely from other devices using the browser.</p><p>2. If the target device is iPhone or iPad, the target device must be jailbroken for mSpy to be used.</p><p>3. The target device must be connected to the internet. mSpy will constantly send information pertaining to text messages or SMS, call logs, WhatsApp messages, etc from the target device to the control panel while it is connected to the internet.</p><p>So, these are the ways to install and start intercepting text messages both for iOS and Android using mSpy and we also listed down a few things that have to be kept in mind while going for mSpy.

If the ping rate is too high or you get errors during the test, your internet likely isn’t stable.</li><li>Keep only one VPN app open at a time. Also, close any other apps that could interfere with the VPN connection.</li><li>Verify that the VPN app is updated to the latest version.</li></ul><p>If the preliminary checks don’t help, proceed to the remaining fixes.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://getlyla.pxf.io/c/5597632/1455723/15391" target="_top" id="1455723"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15391-1455723"                      border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1455723/15391"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Connect-to-an-Alternate-Server"><a href="#2-Connect-to-an-Alternate-Server" class="headerlink" title="2.

Therefore, if you fail to connect to the servers of your VPN provider based in a specific country, try connecting to a different server available.</p><p> Most VPN providers allow connecting to numerous servers across the globe, even if you’re on the free plan. If your app does not offer that or you fail to connect to all servers, try an alternative.</p><h2 id="3-Try-Other-VPN-Apps"><a href="#3-Try-Other-VPN-Apps" class="headerlink" title="3.

Try Other VPN Apps</h2><p> If you’re unable to connect to all the available servers across different countries, there could be a backend or technical issue with your VPN provider. The easiest way to rule out backend issues is to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/best-free-vpn-iphone-ipad/" >try a different VPN app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , preferably one that is more reliable, and connect to one of its servers.</p><p> If the connection is successful, then your primary VPN provider may be the culprit. While you wait for your VPN provider to resolve the issue, you can continue using the other app.</p><p> However, if you can’t connect to a VPN from the other app as well, there may be an issue with the VPN configuration or your iPhone’s settings. So, apply the remaining fixes.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BGeneral%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/general-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Delete-the-VPN-Profile"><a href="#4-Delete-the-VPN-Profile" class="headerlink" title="4. Delete the VPN Profile"></a>4. Delete the VPN Profile</h2><p> A VPN profile enables a device to connect to a private network securely. When you connect to a new VPN for the first time, the app asks for permission to create a new VPN profile. When you grant permission, the app creates a profile, which allows the VPN to monitor or filter your iPhone’s network activity.</p><p> The corruption of VPN profiles can also hinder your connection. Therefore, you should delete the existing profile and add it again to rule out this possibility. Here’s how you can do it:</p><ol><li>Open your iPhone’s Settings app.</li><li>Navigate to<strong>General &gt; VPN &amp; Device Management</strong> .</li><li>Tap on<strong>VPN</strong> .</li><li>Locate the VPN profile associated with your primary VPN, which isn’t connecting.</li><li>Tap the <strong>Info (i)</strong> button next to the relevant VPN profile.</li><li>Tap<strong>Delete VPN</strong> and then tap<strong>Delete</strong> in the confirmation popup.</li><li>When you reopen the VPN app, it will ask for permission to recreate the VPN profile. Grant access and see if it fixes the problem.</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://checkout.abbyy.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=39254762&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/0e5fb5c76fca16adbee503c9aff393cd/products/11_FR-Badges-NEW-FR-Standard-16-WIN-200.png"                      border="0"                > PDF application, powered by AI-based OCR, for unified workflows with both digital and scanned documents. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/opening-the-general-settings-in-the-settings-app-of-an-iphone.jpg"                      alt="Opening the General Settings in the Settings App of an iPhone"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/navigating-to-the-vpn-and-device-management-settings-on-an-iphone.jpg"                      alt="Navigating to the VPN and Device Management Settings on an iPhone"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1300375&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-15_%281%29.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/locating-the-vpn-profile-we-intend-to-delete-in-the-iphone-vpn-and-device-management-settings-on-an-iphone.jpg"                      alt="Locating the VPN Profile We Intend to Delete in the iPhone VPN and Device Management Settings"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/deleting-the-vpn-profile-in-the-vpn-and-device-management-settings-on-an-iphone.jpg"                      alt="Deleting the VPN Profile in the VPN and Device Management Settings on an iPhone"                ></p><p>Close</p><p> If deleting and re-creating your primary VPN profile doesn’t resolve the issue, delete all other VPN profiles you see in the VPN settings menu other than the one you just created.

Change the VPN Protocol</h2><p> A VPN protocol consists of rules that determine the encryption used for data and the way information travels between your iPhone and a VPN server. Almost all VPN providers offer multiple VPN protocols and are configured to automatically connect to the most appropriate one based on the use case.</p><p> The default auto mode is generally the best, but it sometimes malfunctions and causes connection problems. If you’ve also been using the default auto settings, manually switch between available protocols. Depending on your VPN provider, you may need to dig into the app’s settings to change the protocol.</p><p> If manually changing the protocol doesn’t resolve the issue, revert the change and switch to auto again.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=45152835&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://download.terabyteunlimited.com/banners/ad_800x450_d.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-Reset-Your-iPhone’s-Network-Settings"><a href="#6-Reset-Your-iPhone’s-Network-Settings" class="headerlink" title="6.

Resetting your network settings deletes network caches and old data records saved on your device, resolving all network issues.

Once you confirm the process with your device passcode, reconnect to the VPN again to see if you can connect successfully this time.</p><p> Since resetting your network settings erases saved Wi-Fi networks, passwords, VPN profiles, and custom firewall rules, you’ll have to configure them all over again.

If resetting the network settings does not work, you need to rule out this possibility. To do that, connect to your cellular network or a different Wi-Fi network to see if changing the internet provider fixes the issue.</p><p> If you find that your ISP is the culprit, you may need to try a different VPN app to see if that’s blocked as well. You can also contact your ISP directly to have them look into the issue or switch to a different network provider that doesn’t block VPNs altogether.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://vapordna.pxf.io/c/5597632/1496243/17238" target="_top" id="1496243"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17238-1496243"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1221"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1496243/17238"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Get-Your-VPN-Up-and-Running-Again"><a href="#Get-Your-VPN-Up-and-Running-Again" class="headerlink" title="Get Your VPN Up and Running Again"></a>Get Your VPN Up and Running Again</h2><p> Having trouble connecting to a VPN can be frustrating.

Here are the answers to the most frequently asked questions regarding this topic from the internet:</p><ol><li><strong>How do I export WhatsApp chats to legal documents?</strong></li></ol><p>To export WhatsApp chats to legal documents, you need to open WhatsApp on your device. Now locate the conversation you want to export and tap the three-dots option from the top right corner. From the ensuing menu options, select “More” and press “Export Chat.” You will be presented with options to include or exclude media in the export. Select the desired option to export the chat.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Can I track WhatsApp messages on someone else’s device without physical access?</strong></li></ol><p>No, tracking WhatsApp messages on someone else’s device requires physical access to that device. WhatsApp messages are end-to-end encrypted for all users. This means that they are only accessible on the Tecno Phantom V Fold device where the account was registered. To track someone’s WhatsApp messages, you would generally need to install monitoring software. Along with that, you should gain physical access to their device to set up monitoring tools.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>Can I track WhatsApp messages if they are backed up on iCloud?</strong></li></ol><p>WhatsApp provides users with the option to back up their chat history to iCloud. While these backups can help restore chats, they are not designed for real-time tracking purposes. To access the conversations in the backup files, you will need to use a tool or service with decryption capabilities. It is due to the fact that WhatsApp chats are end-to-end encrypted.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://thefitville.pxf.io/c/5597632/1526796/15852" target="_top" id="1526796"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1526796"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="628"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1526796/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In conclusion, tracking WhatsApp messages can be helpful in various scenarios.

If you have, here’s how to go about it.</p><p>Step 1. Get started by heading over to iCloud, and logging in with your credentials.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/article/2017/10/icloud.com-login.jpg"                      alt="sign in to iCloud"                ></p><p>If you are greeted with the two factor authentication process, which asks you to insert a code that was sent to your devices, you can simply skip it by heading to the quick access link at the bottom.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://mindmanager.sjv.io/c/5597632/1787667/20231" target="_top" id="1787667"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20231-1787667"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1787667/20231"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075180348414.jpg"                      alt="skip the two factor authentication process"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075180363658.jpg"                      alt="head to the quick access link"                ></p><p>Step 2. From the dashboard, locate the Find iPhone icon on the second row and click on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075181495657.jpg"                      alt="locate the Find iPhone icon"                ></p><p>Step 3.

Once you know the exact location of your device, you can do one of three things—activate lost mode, trigger an acoustic signal or erase all data.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Solution-2-Google-to-the-Rescue"><a href="#Part-2-Solution-2-Google-to-the-Rescue" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Solution 2 - Google to the Rescue"></a>Part 2: Solution 2 - Google to the Rescue</h2><p>Note that this solution will only work if you have Location Services enabled on your iPhone.</p><p>It’s no surprise that both Apple and the search giant are fond of gathering information on all sorts of things, most notably your location. Google stores this information on its Timeline, so without ado, head to the Google Timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/example-trip-google-timeline.png"                      alt="head to the Google Timeline to track your iPhone"                ></p><p>Step 2. Select the present date from the left hand panel.</p><p>Step 3. Scroll to the bottom of the timeline, and select the latest location update.</p><p>Step 4. If your location is the same as your previous updates, your phone hasn’t moved so you go and get it from that location. Contrarily, if your phone has moved, you should contact authorities, and not go after the thief alone because you never know the type of person they are.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Solution-3-Using-Google-Photos-to-Track-your-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-Solution-3-Using-Google-Photos-to-Track-your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Solution 3 - Using Google Photos to Track your iPhone"></a>Part 3: Solution 3 - Using Google Photos to Track your iPhone</h2><p>If the above Google features do not work for you, the search giant has one more service that can help aka Google Photos.</p><p>This option is somewhat complex, and requires that you have the Google Photos app installed with automatic upload turned on. Further, someone will have to take photos with your iPhone, and in the event it is actually stolen, this is highly unlikely.</p><p>Well, if you have the aforementioned prerequisites, head over to photos.google.com to visit your most recently uploaded photos. If you happen to notice any recent photos, click on them and check their location by clicking on the right sidebar. Again, if you do find the location using this method, it is best to contact your local authorities.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1300375&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-15_%281%29.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075191479909.jpg"                      alt="Use Google Photos to Track your iPhone"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Solution-4-Have-another-iPhone-Use-it-to-Track-one-that’s-gone-missing"><a href="#Part-4-Solution-4-Have-another-iPhone-Use-it-to-Track-one-that’s-gone-missing" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Solution 4.

Good news is that starting from iOS 9, this feature is stock and will already be installed on the Honor Play 7T device.</p><p>Step 1. Open the Find My Friends app on the iPhone that you will use for the tracking, and then enable Share My Location by tapping on their contact picture located at the bottom.</p><p>Ensure that the location is being Shared From This Device as there may be other devices connected with the same iCloud account.</p><p>Step 2. Next enable AirDrop from the control center of your iPhone and make yourself discoverable to everyone. Further hit Add on the tracking iPhone, choose your contact icon and select Share Indefinitely.</p><p>Step 3. Once the tracking iPhone’s location is shared with your device, a popup will appear asking you how long you would like to share your location for, which is where you select Share Indefinitely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075192666907.jpg"                      alt="use another phone to track the missing one"                ></p><p>Step 4.

In this article, we are going to discuss ways to intercept text messages from both iOS and Android Phones and how to know whether your text messages have been intercepted.</p><ul><li><strong>Recommended android&#x2F;ios location faker tool: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Virtual Location - the most trustworthy way to fake GPS on iPhone &#x2F;Android device <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</strong></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="fake GPS of mobile device"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-know-whether-your-text-message-has-been-intercepted"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-know-whether-your-text-message-has-been-intercepted" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to know whether your text message has been intercepted?"></a>Part 1: How to know whether your text message has been intercepted?</h2><p>Intercepting a target phone could give us the controls and allow us to spy on various activities happening on the target phone even to the extent of giving us information about what’s happening in the surrounding. It does this by listening to the conversation by turning on the microphone even when the target phone is not in use. So, while the spying application keeps running in the background silently, text messages can be easily intercepted. So, it is imperative to know and read the signs to actually get to know if your text messages are being intercepted. There are some signs which could give you an idea if your text message has been intercepted.</p><p><strong>Odd Phone Behavior</strong> – If your phone is behaving erratic and lights up suddenly even when not in use, it is possible that the cell phone is being intercepted. Some other signs could be random beeping noise, phone shutting down by itself, etc. While this might happen normally at times, if it is happening on a regular basis, there is a chance that the phone text message or for that matter phone data is being intercepted.</p><p><strong>Battery Rundown</strong> – Some spy software running in the background can consume a lot of battery charge. If there is a dramatic change in the battery consumption and the phone now needs charging more often, it might mean that text messages or the phone is being intercepted.</p><p><strong>Phone Shuts down</strong> – If your phone regularly shuts down by itself, even if the battery is fully charged, there could be one spy application running on the phone.</p><p><strong>Increased data usage</strong> – If you see a dramatic increase in the consumption of data, it could be due to the spy application running silently in the background. The spy applications constantly send the recorded text message logs and data from the target phone which increases data consumption.</p><p>So, these are some signs which could suggest that your text message has been intercepted.</p><p>Intercepting text messages is now very easy using a robust application which can intercept any device in some simple steps.

Install mSpy and set it up</strong></p><p>To start the process, buy mSpy that has to be installed on the target device. mSpy requires account creation and activation. This account with login credentials will be later used to monitor all the activities. You will be asked for an email id in which you will receive the setup procedure.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068407/7443" target="_top" id="2068407"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068407"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068407/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/11/14781232495235.jpg"                      alt="intercept text messages-Install mSpy and set it up"                ></p><p><strong>2.

That’s why many users opt to <strong>turn off Google location tracking</strong> and keep their whereabouts private. Don’t worry. It’s totally fine. You can implement such measures, too, if you’re uncomfortable sharing your location details with Google. All it takes to turn off Google location tracking is just a few taps on your mobile device.</p><p>In this article, we will discuss how Google employs location access on your mobile device.

That’s why you’re given the option to turn off Google location tracking on your Honor Play 7T smartphone. However, take note that doing so might gravely affect the functionality of some Google products. If you don’t want it to happen, there’s an alternative solution you can try. Rather than denying Google access to your location, why not change it instead and register a fake one? Yes. That can absolutely help you conceal your whereabouts without compromising the quality of Google services. Don’t worry. It’s a piece of cake. Wondershare Dr.Fone can help you a lot in this regard. It has a potent Virtual Location feature capable of modifying your whereabouts and simulating GPS movements. Do you want to try it now? Here’s a short guide for you.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download Wondershare Dr.Fone from its <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/"><u>official website.</u></a> Subsequently, install it on your computer.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Launch the newly installed software on your desktop. Once it fully loads up, connect your Honor Play 7T smartphone using a data cable. Follow the on-screen instructions to make sure that the connection between the two devices is stable enough to handle the succeeding procedures.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Go to the left-side panel and then click <strong>Toolbox.</strong> On the main dashboard, click <strong>Virtual Location.</strong> Is it your first time accessing this feature? If so, Wondershare Dr.Fone will then download additional resources from the server. Don’t worry. The downloading process will only take a few minutes.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> After completing the downloading process, Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location will open in a separate window. From there, navigate to the top-right menu bar and then click <strong>Teleport Mode.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png"                      alt="wondershare drfone teleport mode"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Head over to the search bar at the top-left corner of the screen and then enter your desired location.

Imagine you can easily locate a particular place and get directions by simply browsing Google Maps. No need to borrow an Atlas from the library just to find a location you want to visit. However, in exchange for this convenience, you have to share location access with Google. Some users are not confident to access this privilege at the expense of their privacy. Don’t worry. That’s totally fine. If you’re one of them, this article can help you turn off Google location tracking on your Honor Play 7T. Is there a more conservative approach to address this issue? Luckily, there is.

This can be risky at times, especially if you have a stalker. These are the common ways in which people track phones:</p><p>GPS location: all Smartphones come with a GPS chip, which continually gives the GPS location of your device. This is great for several features to work on the phone, but it can also be exploited by malicious people. The GPS location is also used to find lost devices or persons who are challenged in finding directions and may get lost. Therefore the GPS chip function is a double-edged sword.</p><p>IMEI information: This is information that can be tracked using data that is found on your mobile provider’s servers. This is the information that law enforcers use to track crooks, and rescue teams use to track people lost in disaster zones. The IMEI gets recorded when your mobile device pings off mobile transmission towers that are nearby</p><p>The apps that are used by people to track mobile devices will track one of these two features.

The best option is to turn on the GPS when you need it and then turn it off when you do not, or use an iOS spoofing tool.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082538/7443" target="_top" id="2082538"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082538"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082538/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Track-Honor-Magic-6-by-Phone-Number"><a href="#How-to-Track-Honor-Magic-6-by-Phone-Number" class="headerlink" title="How to Track Honor Magic 6 by Phone Number"></a>How to Track Honor Magic 6 by Phone Number</h2><p>In most cases, tracking a lost iPhone has always been made possible thanks to the presence of tracking apps, and the use of the IMEI number. However, in the past few years, it has always been in the public domain and in the minds of many technocrats about the possibility of tracking an iPhone by only using its phone number (cellular number). Regardless of what has been said, tracking an iPhone using its number alone is a process that requires an in-depth understanding and application. In this article, we are going to take a look at the possibility of how to track an iPhone by phone number, as well as the use of the mSpy program to track a lost iPhone.</p><ul><li><strong>Recommended location faker tool: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location - change your mobile device GPS to any place in the world with just 1 click <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>!</strong></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=45152835&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://download.terabyteunlimited.com/banners/ad_800x450_d.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-Is-It-Possible-to-Track-An-iPhone-with-Just-the-Number"><a href="#Part-1-Is-It-Possible-to-Track-An-iPhone-with-Just-the-Number" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Is It Possible to Track An iPhone with Just the Number?"></a>Part 1: Is It Possible to Track An iPhone with Just the Number?</h2><p>A lot of people have always asked me; is it possible to track my iPhone by phone number? Well; regardless of what people say out there, it is usually close to impossible to track your lost iPhone by primarily using only its phone number. In this case, the phone number in question is the number provided to you by your cellular provider. The moment you lose your iPhone, the chances of the thief changing your SIM card to another SIM card are high. This obviously makes it impossible to track your iPhone via a number that is no longer available. However, there’s a leeway on how to track an iPhone by phone number though it depends on sheer chances and lack.</p><p>You can only track iPhone by phone number only if the culprit with the phone doesn’t change the SIM card. This is a sheer lack of procedure when you consider the fact that people nowadays steal phones and change the Sim cards as well as the IMEI numbers. If you want to track your iPhone in such cases, your only option would be to contact your cellular provider and ask them to perform a phone triangulation procedure or tell you if any calls were made using your number. Regardless of the type of iPhone tracking services, you might decide to use; the fact still remains that they can’t track your lost iPhone using the phone number. So don’t be duped by these companies or apps that claim to track your lost phone by using the phone number. What they can only do for you is to tell you the last position where the phone was detected, or if any calls were made and to whom. Basically, for you to trace your iPhone, you need its IMEI number, but not the phone number.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Track-iPhone-Online-via-mSpy"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Track-iPhone-Online-via-mSpy" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Track iPhone Online via mSpy"></a>Part 2: How to Track iPhone Online via mSpy</h2><p>Since it is impossible to track iPhone via the phone number, you can employ the use of secondary software and apps to track and primarily retrieve your iPhone from whoever has the phone. In this case, the application of <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> would be highly recommended. The mSpy program is a highly versatile program that can be used to perform various functions depending on the preferences of the user. In our case at hand, you can use this program to track your iPhone regardless of what part of the world the phone could have been taken to or located.</p><p><strong>TIP:</strong> Please note that you can only track down your iPhone using mSpy by first installing the app on your phone. Without the installation process, tracking your phone using mSpy will be close to impossible.</p><p>The following is a detailed process on how to track an iPhone by number using mSpy phone locating feature.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Purchase-the-App"><a href="#Step-1-Purchase-the-App" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Purchase the App"></a><strong>Step 1:</strong> Purchase the App</h4><p>Your first step is to go to the <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy official website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to download this program and install it on your iPhone.

The outcome or the general experience of tracking a lost phone will solely depend on the methods applied in the overall process.

The only way out of tracking and finding your phone is by using the IMEI number. Any other number used for iPhone tracking purposes will only be for gathering information for investigative reasons.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"

There are a few things to do before you can begin tracking an Android device such as have an active and connected Google account (something you already set up when you bought the Tecno Spark 10 4G device), and locations services on the Tecno Spark 10 4G device enabled. Even though your mobile manufacturer may offer their own exclusive solution to track your phone, Google’s Find My Device (formerly Android Device Manager) is probably the most easiest and trusted way to go with. Here’s how to track your lost phone with Google’s ADM.</p><p>Step 1. Most latest Android phones are already equipped with the Find My Service, but if you’re missing it, you can download it from the Google Play Store. Click start, tap security, and then device administration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15080422869617.jpeg"                      alt="Track Lost Android Mobile Location with Google’s ADM-install Find My Service"                ></p><p>Step 2. Next, tap Find My Device, and check the box besides it. Tap the back button once and then again to return to the main settings menu.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4615471&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/affiliate-image/affiliate_banners_en/max_782x90.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15080423235837.jpeg"                      alt="Track Lost Android Mobile Location-return to the main settings menu"                ></p><p>Step 3.

But what if you don’ have the app installed? Does that mean that you have to bid adieu to your iPhone forever? Not really, because we are about to reveal to you 5 different ways to track your iPhone without app, so you can hopefully find your phone in the condition it went astray.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Solution-1-–-Apple’s-iCloud-to-the-rescue"><a href="#Part-1-Solution-1-–-Apple’s-iCloud-to-the-rescue" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Solution 1 – Apple’s iCloud to the rescue"></a>Part 1: Solution 1 – Apple’s iCloud to the rescue</h2><p>Take note that this solution will not work if you haven’t activated the Find My iPhone service when you set up your device. If you have, here’s how to go about it.</p><p>Step 1. Get started by heading over to iCloud, and logging in with your credentials.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/article/2017/10/icloud.com-login.jpg"                      alt="sign in to iCloud"                ></p><p>If you are greeted with the two factor authentication process, which asks you to insert a code that was sent to your devices, you can simply skip it by heading to the quick access link at the bottom.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4699091&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/bccefcc1b1eee9eca3ae4f5c1a281482/products/1_jutoh-logo-1200x1600.jpg"                      border="0"                >Jutoh Plus -  Jutoh is an ebook creator for Epub, Kindle and more.

Hover over to the All Devices dropdown menu and choose your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075181861335.jpg"                      alt="choose your iPhone"                ></p><p>Step 4. The tracking process will now begin, and you should be able to see it displayed on an interactive map if successful.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075182429793.jpg"                      alt="begin to track the phone"                ></p><p>Step 5.

Google stores this information on its Timeline, so without ado, head to the Google Timeline.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087267/19272" target="_top" id="2087267"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087267"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2087267/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/example-trip-google-timeline.png"                      alt="head to the Google Timeline to track your iPhone"                ></p><p>Step 2. Select the present date from the left hand panel.</p><p>Step 3. Scroll to the bottom of the timeline, and select the latest location update.</p><p>Step 4. If your location is the same as your previous updates, your phone hasn’t moved so you go and get it from that location. Contrarily, if your phone has moved, you should contact authorities, and not go after the thief alone because you never know the type of person they are.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Solution-3-Using-Google-Photos-to-Track-your-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-Solution-3-Using-Google-Photos-to-Track-your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Solution 3 - Using Google Photos to Track your iPhone"></a>Part 3: Solution 3 - Using Google Photos to Track your iPhone</h2><p>If the above Google features do not work for you, the search giant has one more service that can help aka Google Photos.</p><p>This option is somewhat complex, and requires that you have the Google Photos app installed with automatic upload turned on. Further, someone will have to take photos with your iPhone, and in the event it is actually stolen, this is highly unlikely.</p><p>Well, if you have the aforementioned prerequisites, head over to photos.google.com to visit your most recently uploaded photos. If you happen to notice any recent photos, click on them and check their location by clicking on the right sidebar. Again, if you do find the location using this method, it is best to contact your local authorities.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075191479909.jpg"                      alt="Use Google Photos to Track your iPhone"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=33729450&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/7f687767ccf20fcea1c9dc4a5adc2326/Digisigner_banner_728_x_90_color_version.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Solution-4-Have-another-iPhone-Use-it-to-Track-one-that’s-gone-missing"><a href="#Part-4-Solution-4-Have-another-iPhone-Use-it-to-Track-one-that’s-gone-missing" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Solution 4. Have another iPhone? Use it to Track one that’s gone missing"></a>Part 4: Solution 4. Have another iPhone? Use it to Track one that’s gone missing</h2><p>This method requires that you have Find My Friend enabled on both your missing iPhone and the one you’re going to use to track it. Good news is that starting from iOS 9, this feature is stock and will already be installed on the Honor Magic 5 device.</p><p>Step 1. Open the Find My Friends app on the iPhone that you will use for the tracking, and then enable Share My Location by tapping on their contact picture located at the bottom.</p><p>Ensure that the location is being Shared From This Device as there may be other devices connected with the same iCloud account.</p><p>Step 2. Next enable AirDrop from the control center of your iPhone and make yourself discoverable to everyone. Further hit Add on the tracking iPhone, choose your contact icon and select Share Indefinitely.</p><p>Step 3. Once the tracking iPhone’s location is shared with your device, a popup will appear asking you how long you would like to share your location for, which is where you select Share Indefinitely.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1047974&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-04_%281%29.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075192666907.jpg"                      alt="use another phone to track the missing one"                ></p><p>Step 4.

It does this by listening to the conversation by turning on the microphone even when the target phone is not in use. So, while the spying application keeps running in the background silently, text messages can be easily intercepted. So, it is imperative to know and read the signs to actually get to know if your text messages are being intercepted. There are some signs which could give you an idea if your text message has been intercepted.</p><p><strong>Odd Phone Behavior</strong> – If your phone is behaving erratic and lights up suddenly even when not in use, it is possible that the cell phone is being intercepted. Some other signs could be random beeping noise, phone shutting down by itself, etc. While this might happen normally at times, if it is happening on a regular basis, there is a chance that the phone text message or for that matter phone data is being intercepted.</p><p><strong>Battery Rundown</strong> – Some spy software running in the background can consume a lot of battery charge. If there is a dramatic change in the battery consumption and the phone now needs charging more often, it might mean that text messages or the phone is being intercepted.</p><p><strong>Phone Shuts down</strong> – If your phone regularly shuts down by itself, even if the battery is fully charged, there could be one spy application running on the phone.</p><p><strong>Increased data usage</strong> – If you see a dramatic increase in the consumption of data, it could be due to the spy application running silently in the background. The spy applications constantly send the recorded text message logs and data from the target phone which increases data consumption.</p><p>So, these are some signs which could suggest that your text message has been intercepted.</p><p>Intercepting text messages is now very easy using a robust application which can intercept any device in some simple steps. Moreover, the application can be used with both iOS and Android devices.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2084399/18498" target="_top" id="2084399"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2084399"                      border="0" alt="" width="1125" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2084399/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Intercepting-text-messages-from-both-iOS-and-Android-phones"><a href="#Part-2-Intercepting-text-messages-from-both-iOS-and-Android-phones" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Intercepting text messages from both iOS and Android phones"></a>Part 2: Intercepting text messages from both iOS and Android phones</h2><p><strong>mSpy:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a popular application that is compatible with both iPhone and Android. mSpy for the phone has all the features which make this application a unique one to go for. mSpy for phones could give information regarding text messages on the target device and chats. Moreover, mSpy also gives information about call logs and contacts along with access to the IM chats like WhatsApp monitoring, Snapchat monitoring, etc. mSpy also allows you to view the photos and videos taken or stored or just viewed on the target device. mSpy can remotely erase the targeted phone’s data.

So, text message interception is possible with both iPhone and Android using mSpy.</p><p><strong>Using mSpy to intercept text messages from other phones</strong></p><p>To be able to intercept text messages from other phones, it is first required to install the mSpy application on the target phone that has to be intercepted. Here are some steps to intercept text messages using mSpy from other phones:</p><p><strong>1. Install mSpy and set it up</strong></p><p>To start the process, buy mSpy that has to be installed on the target device. mSpy requires account creation and activation. This account with login credentials will be later used to monitor all the activities. You will be asked for an email id in which you will receive the setup procedure.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/11/14781232495235.jpg"                      alt="intercept text messages-Install mSpy and set it up"                ></p><p><strong>2.

Once the application is set up, it is going to work invisibly and the target user will never get to know that he is being monitored. The target phone will work normally and mSpy will not interfere in any of the applications installed on the target phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/11/14781234928456.jpg"                      alt="intercept text messages-Install the application"                ></p><p>Installing in Android</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/11/14781239566126.jpg"                      alt="intercept text messages-Installing in Android"                ></p><p>Installing on iOS</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/11/14781241065208.jpg"                      alt="intercept text messages-Installing on iOS"                ></p><p><strong>3.

While it is possible to remotely access data, monitor, and control the target device, it is imperative to have physical access to the target device to install the application, grant permissions, and set the application up. This is a one-time task that needs to be done before you start accessing the target device records remotely from other devices using the browser.</p><p>2. If the target device is iPhone or iPad, the target device must be jailbroken for mSpy to be used.</p><p>3. The target device must be connected to the internet. mSpy will constantly send information pertaining to text messages or SMS, call logs, WhatsApp messages, etc from the target device to the control panel while it is connected to the internet.</p><p>So, these are the ways to install and start intercepting text messages both for iOS and Android using mSpy and we also listed down a few things that have to be kept in mind while going for mSpy.

This app comes with the facility to get a notification when the target person arrives or leaves a place. Here, if you have access to the target device and the “Find my friends” option then it will give you the solution on how to track a cell phone without them knowing.</p><p>Step1: Enable the option “Share my location” on the target phone. To enable share my location, open the app “Find my friends” &gt; Go for the contact’s photo &gt; “Share my location”.</p><p>Step 2: Generally iCloud account has sharing options for all other devices. We have to ensure the sharing option is correctly viewed as the target device such as “This device”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/11/15100182891050.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone without them knowing-share my location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Now swipe from bottom to end, click on the “Airdrop” option from the settings. You will have two options such as “Everyone” and “Contacts only”.</p><p>Step 4: Move to the target device, in the “Find my friends” app click the option “add”. Now your contact picture will get displayed. Click on your profile photo &gt; select the option “Share indefinitely” to track a cell phone without them knowing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/11/15100183209840.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone without them knowing-Share indefinitely"                ></p><p>Step 5: The target device location will be shared with you.

Google stores this information on its Timeline, so without ado, head to the Google Timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/example-trip-google-timeline.png"                      alt="head to the Google Timeline to track your iPhone"                ></p><p>Step 2. Select the present date from the left hand panel.</p><p>Step 3. Scroll to the bottom of the timeline, and select the latest location update.</p><p>Step 4. If your location is the same as your previous updates, your phone hasn’t moved so you go and get it from that location. Contrarily, if your phone has moved, you should contact authorities, and not go after the thief alone because you never know the type of person they are.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ukaidot.sjv.io/c/5597632/1793233/19578" target="_top" id="1793233"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19578-1793233"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="1200"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793233/19578"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Solution-3-Using-Google-Photos-to-Track-your-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-Solution-3-Using-Google-Photos-to-Track-your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Solution 3 - Using Google Photos to Track your iPhone"></a>Part 3: Solution 3 - Using Google Photos to Track your iPhone</h2><p>If the above Google features do not work for you, the search giant has one more service that can help aka Google Photos.</p><p>This option is somewhat complex, and requires that you have the Google Photos app installed with automatic upload turned on. Further, someone will have to take photos with your iPhone, and in the event it is actually stolen, this is highly unlikely.</p><p>Well, if you have the aforementioned prerequisites, head over to photos.google.com to visit your most recently uploaded photos.

But what if you don’ have the app installed? Does that mean that you have to bid adieu to your iPhone forever? Not really, because we are about to reveal to you 5 different ways to track your iPhone without app, so you can hopefully find your phone in the condition it went astray.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Solution-1-–-Apple’s-iCloud-to-the-rescue"><a href="#Part-1-Solution-1-–-Apple’s-iCloud-to-the-rescue" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Solution 1 – Apple’s iCloud to the rescue"></a>Part 1: Solution 1 – Apple’s iCloud to the rescue</h2><p>Take note that this solution will not work if you haven’t activated the Find My iPhone service when you set up your device. If you have, here’s how to go about it.</p><p>Step 1. Get started by heading over to iCloud, and logging in with your credentials.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620780&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/728__90banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/article/2017/10/icloud.com-login.jpg"                      alt="sign in to iCloud"                ></p><p>If you are greeted with the two factor authentication process, which asks you to insert a code that was sent to your devices, you can simply skip it by heading to the quick access link at the bottom.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075180348414.jpg"                      alt="skip the two factor authentication process"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075180363658.jpg"                      alt="head to the quick access link"                ></p><p>Step 2. From the dashboard, locate the Find iPhone icon on the second row and click on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075181495657.jpg"                      alt="locate the Find iPhone icon"                ></p><p>Step 3. Hover over to the All Devices dropdown menu and choose your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075181861335.jpg"                      alt="choose your iPhone"                ></p><p>Step 4. The tracking process will now begin, and you should be able to see it displayed on an interactive map if successful.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075182429793.jpg"                      alt="begin to track the phone"                ></p><p>Step 5. Once you know the exact location of your device, you can do one of three things—activate lost mode, trigger an acoustic signal or erase all data.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Solution-2-Google-to-the-Rescue"><a href="#Part-2-Solution-2-Google-to-the-Rescue" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Solution 2 - Google to the Rescue"></a>Part 2: Solution 2 - Google to the Rescue</h2><p>Note that this solution will only work if you have Location Services enabled on your iPhone.</p><p>It’s no surprise that both Apple and the search giant are fond of gathering information on all sorts of things, most notably your location. Google stores this information on its Timeline, so without ado, head to the Google Timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/example-trip-google-timeline.png"                      alt="head to the Google Timeline to track your iPhone"                ></p><p>Step 2. Select the present date from the left hand panel.</p><p>Step 3. Scroll to the bottom of the timeline, and select the latest location update.</p><p>Step 4. If your location is the same as your previous updates, your phone hasn’t moved so you go and get it from that location. Contrarily, if your phone has moved, you should contact authorities, and not go after the thief alone because you never know the type of person they are.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068416/7443" target="_top" id="2068416"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068416"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068416/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Solution-3-Using-Google-Photos-to-Track-your-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-Solution-3-Using-Google-Photos-to-Track-your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Solution 3 - Using Google Photos to Track your iPhone"></a>Part 3: Solution 3 - Using Google Photos to Track your iPhone</h2><p>If the above Google features do not work for you, the search giant has one more service that can help aka Google Photos.</p><p>This option is somewhat complex, and requires that you have the Google Photos app installed with automatic upload turned on. Further, someone will have to take photos with your iPhone, and in the event it is actually stolen, this is highly unlikely.</p><p>Well, if you have the aforementioned prerequisites, head over to photos.google.com to visit your most recently uploaded photos. If you happen to notice any recent photos, click on them and check their location by clicking on the right sidebar. Again, if you do find the location using this method, it is best to contact your local authorities.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075191479909.jpg"                      alt="Use Google Photos to Track your iPhone"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.advancedwebranking.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4715051&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/14edc6ebfdae2e23bbed83d67f50e983/products/33_awr%20logo.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Solution-4-Have-another-iPhone-Use-it-to-Track-one-that’s-gone-missing"><a href="#Part-4-Solution-4-Have-another-iPhone-Use-it-to-Track-one-that’s-gone-missing" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Solution 4. Have another iPhone? Use it to Track one that’s gone missing"></a>Part 4: Solution 4. Have another iPhone? Use it to Track one that’s gone missing</h2><p>This method requires that you have Find My Friend enabled on both your missing iPhone and the one you’re going to use to track it. Good news is that starting from iOS 9, this feature is stock and will already be installed on the Honor Magic 5 Lite device.</p><p>Step 1. Open the Find My Friends app on the iPhone that you will use for the tracking, and then enable Share My Location by tapping on their contact picture located at the bottom.</p><p>Ensure that the location is being Shared From This Device as there may be other devices connected with the same iCloud account.</p><p>Step 2. Next enable AirDrop from the control center of your iPhone and make yourself discoverable to everyone. Further hit Add on the tracking iPhone, choose your contact icon and select Share Indefinitely.</p><p>Step 3. Once the tracking iPhone’s location is shared with your device, a popup will appear asking you how long you would like to share your location for, which is where you select Share Indefinitely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075192666907.jpg"                      alt="use another phone to track the missing one"                ></p><p>Step 4.

This can be done by tracking the phone number based on information derived from mobile carriers and also from the GPS chip on the phone which is used by certain apps in order to function well.</p><p>You may not want your GPS location tracked by anyone or by apps on your device. When playing games like Pokémon Go, the geo-location data on your device is used to pinpoint where you are for purposes of gameplay. In the same manner, malicious people can track you same way. Here you will learn how to stop someone from tracking your phone in simple and easy ways.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-do-people-track-your-phone"><a href="#Part-1-How-do-people-track-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How do people track your phone?"></a>Part 1: How do people track your phone?</h2><p>There are several ways in which people can track the location of your phone. This can be risky at times, especially if you have a stalker. These are the common ways in which people track phones:</p><p>GPS location: all Smartphones come with a GPS chip, which continually gives the GPS location of your device. This is great for several features to work on the phone, but it can also be exploited by malicious people. The GPS location is also used to find lost devices or persons who are challenged in finding directions and may get lost. Therefore the GPS chip function is a double-edged sword.</p><p>IMEI information: This is information that can be tracked using data that is found on your mobile provider’s servers. This is the information that law enforcers use to track crooks, and rescue teams use to track people lost in disaster zones. The IMEI gets recorded when your mobile device pings off mobile transmission towers that are nearby</p><p>The apps that are used by people to track mobile devices will track one of these two features. If you do not want to be tracked, then you have to find ways in which to disable these functions.</p><p>The sections below will show you how to stop someone from tracking your iPhone with ease.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-stop-my-iPhone-from-being-tracked"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-stop-my-iPhone-from-being-tracked" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to stop my iPhone from being tracked?"></a>Part 2: How to stop my iPhone from being tracked?</h2><p>If you have an iPhone, the following methods can be used to stop someone from tracking your device</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=2337838&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><iframe width="640" height="390" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rzZwphIv4RM" title="APFill - Ink and Toner Coverage Calculator" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Use-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-iOS-Android"><a href="#1-Use-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-iOS-Android" class="headerlink" title="1) Use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location(iOS&#x2F;Android)"></a>1) Use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location(iOS&#x2F;Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>This is a tool that you can use to change the virtual location of your device(iOS or Android).

Here are the answers to the most frequently asked questions regarding this topic from the internet:</p><ol><li><strong>How do I export WhatsApp chats to legal documents?</strong></li></ol><p>To export WhatsApp chats to legal documents, you need to open WhatsApp on your device. Now locate the conversation you want to export and tap the three-dots option from the top right corner. From the ensuing menu options, select “More” and press “Export Chat.” You will be presented with options to include or exclude media in the export. Select the desired option to export the chat.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Can I track WhatsApp messages on someone else’s device without physical access?</strong></li></ol><p>No, tracking WhatsApp messages on someone else’s device requires physical access to that device. WhatsApp messages are end-to-end encrypted for all users. This means that they are only accessible on the Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G device where the account was registered. To track someone’s WhatsApp messages, you would generally need to install monitoring software. Along with that, you should gain physical access to their device to set up monitoring tools.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>Can I track WhatsApp messages if they are backed up on iCloud?</strong></li></ol><p>WhatsApp provides users with the option to back up their chat history to iCloud. While these backups can help restore chats, they are not designed for real-time tracking purposes. To access the conversations in the backup files, you will need to use a tool or service with decryption capabilities. It is due to the fact that WhatsApp chats are end-to-end encrypted.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In conclusion, tracking WhatsApp messages can be helpful in various scenarios.

It works by connecting our car with the mobile phone and allowing us to know at all times the location of our car, something very useful in case of missing or even theft. In addition, in case of an accident, we can notify the emergency services through the same application.</p><p>This app to find your car consists of a sensor connected to the mobile application and all we have to do is install it in the OBD (On Board Diagnostics) port of our vehicle, usually located next to the instrument control or around of the center console. It is available for iOS. Apart from looking for the car, this app allows us to control through Bluetooth also the consumption of gasoline, the effort that has made the engine, if you suffer and how to avoid it while advising us on how to achieve and maintain optimal driving.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>Can receive free emergency help in case of a crash.</p><p>GPS locator for car</p><p>Available in English.</p><p>Compatible with iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch</p><p>Control if you need gasoline through Bluetooth</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15081723208344.jpg"                      alt="Car Locator Apps-Automatic"                ></p><p>URL:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/automatic-classic/id596594365?mt=8" >https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/automatic-classic/id596594365?mt=8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Option-4-Google-Maps-It-will-be-available-in-the-next-version"><a href="#Option-4-Google-Maps-It-will-be-available-in-the-next-version" class="headerlink" title="Option 4: Google Maps (It will be available in the next version)"></a>Option 4: Google Maps (It will be available in the next version)</h2><p>Introduction: This application is implementing new features for drivers to find parking more easily. It tries to help those forgetful drivers who park but then do not know where they parked the vehicle. For them, Maps is responsible for collecting information on the time in which they have been stopped after moving by car, if we have the mobile connected to the car by Bluetooth, the application understands that we have been using a vehicle, and shows the parking with a round blue icon with a capital P inside. If this does not appear, it can also be saved in another way. Once parked you can open the map of the application and click on the blue point of location. At that time it gives us the option to Save your parking leaving the blue icon mentioned above.</p><p>The second functionality of Google Maps in developing is the option to know where we can find available parking. In addition to the information collected by the application of our travels, it is able to show the most traveled places and with or greater parking so it can inform you where you are most likely to find parking. How does it work? A small red icon with a blank P appears next to the destination that we selected in our search. Next to the letter appears a text that indicates information about the parking in that zone.</p><p>Unfortunately, these options are not yet implemented on all Android and iOS smartphones. If our mobile phone does not yet have any of these features wait for the latest update as it is expected to be available on these operating systems very soon as a car locator device.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>GPS locator for car</p><p>Shows available parking.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15081723711372.jpg"                      alt="Car Locator Apps-Google Maps"                ></p><p>URL is not available yet.</p><h2 id="Option-5-Waze"><a href="#Option-5-Waze" class="headerlink" title="Option 5: Waze"></a>Option 5: Waze</h2><p>Introduction: This app, compatible with Android and iOS is intended for users who go by car.</p><p>It allows to obtain routes and check movements in real time, besides visualizing possible obstacles in your way.</p><p>The application goes beyond navigation because it permits drivers to share road reports on accidents, police checks or any other danger along their way and get information about what is coming also. It uses satellite technology, so it does not require internet. This application helps you to find parking areas when you need one and can be activated as a GPS locator for the car.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>It is a car locator</p><p>Thanks to GPS you can find available parking</p><p>Get information in real-time if there is any problem in the way.</p><p>It is free and very easy to use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15081724223630.jpg"                      alt="Car Locator Apps-Waze"                ></p><p>URL for Android:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waze&amp;hl=en" >https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waze&amp;hl=en <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>URL for iPhone:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/waze-navigation-live-traffic/id323229106?mt=8" >https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/waze-navigation-live-traffic/id323229106?mt=8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>So, now onwards, you do not need to pay to get a GPS locator for the car, as you can see, there are many available options that you can use and choose to locate your car for free for both iOS and Android devices.

This app comes with the facility to get a notification when the target person arrives or leaves a place. Here, if you have access to the target device and the “Find my friends” option then it will give you the solution on how to track a cell phone without them knowing.</p><p>Step1: Enable the option “Share my location” on the target phone. To enable share my location, open the app “Find my friends” &gt; Go for the contact’s photo &gt; “Share my location”.</p><p>Step 2: Generally iCloud account has sharing options for all other devices. We have to ensure the sharing option is correctly viewed as the target device such as “This device”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/11/15100182891050.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone without them knowing-share my location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Now swipe from bottom to end, click on the “Airdrop” option from the settings. You will have two options such as “Everyone” and “Contacts only”.</p><p>Step 4: Move to the target device, in the “Find my friends” app click the option “add”. Now your contact picture will get displayed. Click on your profile photo &gt; select the option “Share indefinitely” to track a cell phone without them knowing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/11/15100183209840.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone without them knowing-Share indefinitely"                ></p><p>Step 5: The target device location will be shared with you.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="5-Ways-to-Track-Honor-V-Purse-without-App"><a href="#5-Ways-to-Track-Honor-V-Purse-without-App" class="headerlink" title="5 Ways to Track Honor V Purse without App"></a>5 Ways to Track Honor V Purse without App</h2><p>The Find My Honor V Purse app is a great addition to your iPhone, and as the name suggests helps you to not only track your phone in the event it is stolen, but also lock it so that it cannot be misused. But what if you don’ have the app installed? Does that mean that you have to bid adieu to your iPhone forever? Not really, because we are about to reveal to you 5 different ways to track your iPhone without app, so you can hopefully find your phone in the condition it went astray.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Solution-1-–-Apple’s-iCloud-to-the-rescue"><a href="#Part-1-Solution-1-–-Apple’s-iCloud-to-the-rescue" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Solution 1 – Apple’s iCloud to the rescue"></a>Part 1: Solution 1 – Apple’s iCloud to the rescue</h2><p>Take note that this solution will not work if you haven’t activated the Find My iPhone service when you set up your device. If you have, here’s how to go about it.</p><p>Step 1. Get started by heading over to iCloud, and logging in with your credentials.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/article/2017/10/icloud.com-login.jpg"                      alt="sign in to iCloud"                ></p><p>If you are greeted with the two factor authentication process, which asks you to insert a code that was sent to your devices, you can simply skip it by heading to the quick access link at the bottom.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075180348414.jpg"                      alt="skip the two factor authentication process"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075180363658.jpg"                      alt="head to the quick access link"                ></p><p>Step 2. From the dashboard, locate the Find iPhone icon on the second row and click on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075181495657.jpg"                      alt="locate the Find iPhone icon"                ></p><p>Step 3. Hover over to the All Devices dropdown menu and choose your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075181861335.jpg"                      alt="choose your iPhone"                ></p><p>Step 4. The tracking process will now begin, and you should be able to see it displayed on an interactive map if successful.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42570605&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://cdnwww.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2023/usbXcopy/Nero_USB_x_copy_Screen_2.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075182429793.jpg"                      alt="begin to track the phone"                ></p><p>Step 5. Once you know the exact location of your device, you can do one of three things—activate lost mode, trigger an acoustic signal or erase all data.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ancheer.sjv.io/c/5597632/1657301/17326" target="_top" id="1657301"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17326-1657301"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="933"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657301/17326"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Solution-2-Google-to-the-Rescue"><a href="#Part-2-Solution-2-Google-to-the-Rescue" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Solution 2 - Google to the Rescue"></a>Part 2: Solution 2 - Google to the Rescue</h2><p>Note that this solution will only work if you have Location Services enabled on your iPhone.</p><p>It’s no surprise that both Apple and the search giant are fond of gathering information on all sorts of things, most notably your location. Google stores this information on its Timeline, so without ado, head to the Google Timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/example-trip-google-timeline.png"                      alt="head to the Google Timeline to track your iPhone"                ></p><p>Step 2. Select the present date from the left hand panel.</p><p>Step 3. Scroll to the bottom of the timeline, and select the latest location update.</p><p>Step 4. If your location is the same as your previous updates, your phone hasn’t moved so you go and get it from that location. Contrarily, if your phone has moved, you should contact authorities, and not go after the thief alone because you never know the type of person they are.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluettieu.pxf.io/c/5597632/2042323/17091" target="_top" id="2042323"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17091-2042323"                      border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC180T" width="3840" height="1600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2042323/17091"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Solution-3-Using-Google-Photos-to-Track-your-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-Solution-3-Using-Google-Photos-to-Track-your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Solution 3 - Using Google Photos to Track your iPhone"></a>Part 3: Solution 3 - Using Google Photos to Track your iPhone</h2><p>If the above Google features do not work for you, the search giant has one more service that can help aka Google Photos.</p><p>This option is somewhat complex, and requires that you have the Google Photos app installed with automatic upload turned on.
